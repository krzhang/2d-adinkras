\title{Structural Theory of 2D Adinkras}
\author{Kevin Iga and Yan X Zhang}

\begin{document}

\pagestyle{plain}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Adinkras are combinatorial objects developed to study supersymmetry representations. Most of the work so far on Adinkras apply to $1$-dimensional supersymmetry; in this paper, we give formal definitions and structural theorems for \emph{$2$-d Adinkras} to study $2$-dimensional supersymmetry. We show that the natural definitions we want (products, quotients, etc.) behave unexpectedly well, having a nice interplay with the classical theory of \emph{switching graphs}. Our main result is settling a conjecture of H\"ubsch, which helps us understand most of the structure of $2$-d Adinkras. The methods are mostly self-contained.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}
Adinkras (in this paper, called $1$-d Adinkras) were introduced in \cite{d2l:first} to study representations of the super-Poincar\'e algebra in one dimension.  There have been a number of developments that have led to the classification of $1$-d Adinkras.\cite{d2l:graph-theoretic,d2l:omni,d2l:topology,zhang:adinkras,dil:cohomology,d2l:decodes}  Based on the success of this program, there have been a few recent approaches to using Adinkra-like ideas to study the super-Poincar\'e algebra in two dimensions.  This has led to the development of $2$-d Adinkras.\cite{gates:dimensional_extension,hubsch:weaving}

In this paper, we characterize $2$-d Adinkras.  At the core of this is the proof of a conjecture made in \cite{hubsch:weaving}.  In the language we use in this paper, the theorem is as follows:

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:main}
Let $A$ be a connected $2$-d Adinkra.  Then there exist $1$-d Adinkras $A_1$ and $A_2$ with $p$ and $q$ colors, respectively, so that
\[A\cong F(A_1\times A_2)/\sim\]
where $F$ is a vertex switch and  $\sim$ is described by a subgroup of $\ZZ_2^n$.
\end{thm}

In \cite{hubsch:weaving}, the conjecture was phrased differently, and in Appendix~\ref{app:repn}, we explain the connection between these two formulations, as well as more generally explain the relation between $2$-d Adinkras and representations of the super-Poincar\'e algebra in two dimensions.

In this paper, we begin in Section~\ref{sec:prelim} by recalling the definition of $1$-d Adinkras and some of their features.  In Section~\ref{sec:2d} we define a $2$-d Adinkra in the spirit of \cite{gates:dimensional_extension,hubsch:weaving}.  In Section~\ref{sec:products} we define how the product of two $1$-d Adinkras makes a $2$-d Adinkra, in the fashion described in the above theorem.  In Section~\ref{sec:quotient}, we prove the main theorem.
\com{Not sure how the rest will be laid out.  Once we decide this, we can fill in details here}

\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:prelim}

\subsection{$1$-d Adinkras}
\label{sec:1d}
Adinkras in \cite{d2l:first,d2l:graph-theoretic,zhang:adinkras} will be referred to as $1$-d Adinkras in this paper, since they relate to supersymmetry in $1$ dimension.  We will review a definition of $1$-d Adinkras now.

\begin{definition}[$1$-d Adinkras]
Let $n$ be a non-negative integer.  A \emph{$1$-d Adinkra} with $n$ colors is $(V,E,c,\mu,h)$ where
\begin{itemize}
\item $(V,E)$ is a finite undirected graph (called the \emph{underlying graph} of the Adinkra) with vertex set\footnote{In \cite{d2l:first,d2l:graph-theoretic}, there is also a bipartition of the vertices, where some vertices are represented by open circles and called bosons, and other vertices are represented by filled circles and called fermions.  This is not necessary to include in our definition, because the bipartition can be obtained directly from the grading and property 5 below.}
 $V$ and edge set $E\subset V\times V$,
\item $c:E\to [n] := \{1,\ldots,n\}$ is a map called the \emph{coloring},
\item $\mu:E\to \ZZ_2=\{0,1\}$ is a map called the \emph{dashing},
\item $h:V\to\ZZ$ is a map called the \emph{grading}.
\end{itemize}

These are required to satisfy the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $(v,w)\in E$, then $(w,v)\in E$.  Furthermore, $c(v,w)=c(w,v)$ and $\mu(v,w)=\mu(w,v)$.  Intuitively, the edges are undirected.
\item For every $v\in V$ and $c\in [n]$, there exist exactly one $w\in V$ so that $(v,w)\in E$ and $c(v,w)=c$.
\item Every two-colored simple cycle must be of length 4.  (A \emph{simple} cycle is one which does not repeat vertices, with the exception of the start vertex equalling the end vertex.  A \emph{two-colored} cycle is one where the set of colors of the edges is of cardinality exactly two.)
\item The parity of $\mu$ on every two-colored simple cycle is 1.  The parity of $\mu$ on a cycle given by vertices $(v_0,\ldots,v_k)$ means the sum
\[\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\mu(v_i,v_{i+1})\pmod{2}.\]
If any dashing $\mu$ satisfies this condition for all two-colored simple cycles, we call $\mu$ \emph{admissible}.
\item If $(v,w)\in E$, then $|h(v)-h(w)|=1$.
\end{enumerate}

Figure~\ref{fig:1d-examples} give examples of 1-d Adinkras.

\subsection{The action of $\ZZ_2^n$ and the code}
\label{sec:code}
The material in this section is mainly found in \cite{d2l:omni,zhang:adinkras}.  Let $A$ be a $1$-d Adinkra with $n$ colors, with vertex set $V$.  For all $i\in [n]$, define
\[q_i:V\to V\]
so that for all $v\in V$, $q_i(v)$ is the unique vertex joined to $v$ by an edge of color $i$.

\com{Do we really need to define this?}
\begin{definition}[Graph homomorphisms]
\label{defn:homomorphism}
A \emph{graph homomorphism} from a graph $(V_1,E_1)$ to a graph $(V_2,E_2)$ is a map $\phi:V_1\to V_2$ so that if $(v,w)\in E_1$ is an edge, then $(\phi(v),\phi(w))\in E_2$ is an edge.  If there is a coloring $c_1:E_1\to [n]$ and a coloring $c_2:E_2\to [n]$, we say that $\phi$ \emph{preserves colors} if $c_1(v,w)=c_2(\phi(v),\phi(w))$.  We likewise define what it means for $\phi$ to \emph{preserve dashings} or \emph{preserve gradings}.  If $\phi$ is bijective, we say that it is a \emph{graph isomorphism}.
\end{definition}

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:qmap}
The map $q_i$ is a graph isomorphism from the underlying graph of $A$ to itself which preserves colors.  It is an involution and for all $i$, $j$, we have
\begin{equation}
q_i\circ q_j=q_j\circ q_i.\label{eq:commute}
\end{equation}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
The statement that $q_i$ is a graph homomorphism means that if $(v,w)$ is an edge in $A$, then so is $(q_i(v),q_i(w))$.  This follows from items 2 and 3 in the definition of an Adinkra above, using $j=c(v,w)$.

The fact that $q_i(q_i(v))=v$ for all $v\in V$ follows from item 2 in the definition.  This means that $q_i$ is an involution and in particular is an isomorphism.

The equation (\ref{eq:commute}) follows from item 3 of the definition when $i\not=j$ and is trivial when $i=j$.
\end{proof}

By combining the $q_1,\ldots, q_n$ maps, we can define an action of $\ZZ_2^n$ on the graph $(V,E)$ underlying the Adinkra in the following way:
\begin{definition}
The action of $\ZZ_2^n$ on the graph $(V,E)$ underlying the Adinkra is given on vertices by
\[(x_1,\ldots,x_n)v=q_1^{x_1}\circ\cdots\circ q_n^{x_n}(v).\]
\end{definition}
The fact that this is an action by graph isomorphisms that preserve colors follows straightforwardly from Proposition~\ref{prop:qmap}.

Intuitively, the action of a sequence of bits, for instance, $11001$, on a vertex is obtained by following edges with colors that correspond to a $1$ (in this case, colors $1$, $2$, and $5$).  The fact that the $q_i$'s commute implies that the order of the colors does not matter.


\begin{prop}
\label{prop:transitive}
The Adinkra $A$ is connected if and only if the $\ZZ_2^n$ action is transitive on the vertex set of $A$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
This follows directly from interpreting the group action as following edges with various colors.  A path in the graph corresponds to a sequence of edges, which, depending on the color, gives an action of $q_i$.  The composite of these $q_i$'s, reordered using the commutativity of the $q_i$'s, is an action of an element of $\ZZ_2^n$.

\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
If $A$ is connected, then the stabilizers of all vertices are equal.  Define $C(A)$, the \emph{code of the Adinkra} $A$, to be this stabilizer.  As a subgroup of $\ZZ_2^n$, this is a binary block code of length $n$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
In general the stabilizers of two points in the same orbit are conjugate, but because the group is abelian, they are the same.
\end{proof}

The code $C$ is always a doubly-even code\cite{d2l:omni,d2l:decodes}, meaning that every codeword has a number of $1$s that is a multiple of $4$.


\subsection{Vertex switching}
\label{sec:vertexswitch}

\com{As stated in email, for sake of making introduction shorter it may be good to move this to where it is needed - since we don't use this for a long time, and only in an isolated area really.}
The following concept is first introduced in \cite{d2l:first}, and is more thoroughly set in its context in \cite{dil:cohomology,zhang:adinkras}.

\begin{definition}[Vertex switching]
Given an Adinkra $A$, and a vertex $v$ of $A$, we define \emph{vertex switching at $v$} to be the operation on $A$ that returns a new Adinkra $A'$ with the same vertices, edges, coloring, and grading but a new dashing $\mu'$ so that
\begin{equation}
\mu'(e)=\begin{cases}
1-\mu(e),&\mbox{if $e$ is incident to $v$}\\
\mu(e),&\mbox{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
A vertex switching of $A$ is a composition of vertex switchings at various vertices of $A$.
\end{definition}

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:switching-still-adinkra}
If $A$ is an Adinkra, then so is $A'$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Since the vertices, edges, coloring, and grading(s) are the same, the only thing to check is the admissibility of $\mu'$.  That is, given colors $c_1$ and $c_2$, and vertices $v$, $w$, $x$, and $y$, such that $(v,w)$ and $(x,y)$ are edges with color $c_1$ and $(w,x)$ and $(y,v)$ are edges with color $c_2$, that $\mu'(v,w)+\mu'(w,x)+\mu'(x,y)+\mu'(y,v)$ is odd.  If $v'$ is none of these vertices, then this sum is unchanged.  If $v'$ is any of these vertices, for instance, $v$, then $\mu'(v,w)$ and $\mu'(y,v)$ are both changed modulo $2$, so that the sum modulo $2$ is still unchanged.
\end{proof}

Douglas, Gates, and Wang \cite{douglas} examined dashings in Adinkras from a point of view inspired by Seidel's \emph{two-graphs} \cite{seidel:survey} \footnote{In Seidel's setting, \emph{vertex switching} switched the existence of edges, not the sign of edges; this can be seen as equivalent our definition applied to the complete graph. The type of vertex switching we do in this paper is sometimes called vertex switching on \emph{signed graphs} in literature for disambiguation.}. The second author \cite{zhang:adinkras} enumerated vertex switching classes and the number of dashings of $1$-d Adinkras.

\section{$2$-d Adinkras}
\label{sec:2d}
We would like to study $2$-d supersymmetry. The corresponding notion of what $2$-d Adinkras should be is described in \cite{gates:dimensional_extension,hubsch:weaving}.  We use a definition here that is equivalent to the one found there: the proof is found in Appendix \com{...[maybe?]}

A $2$-d Adinkra is similar to a $1$-d Adinkra except that some colors are called ``left-moving'' and the other colors called ``right-moving''.  Edges are called ``left-moving'' if they are colored by left-moving edges, and right-moving otherwise.  Furthermore, there are two gradings, one that is affected by the left-moving edges and the other for the right-moving edges. More formally,
\begin{definition}[$2$-d Adinkras]
Let $p$ and $q$ be non-negative integers. A \emph{2-d Adinkra} with $(p,q)$ colors is a 1-d Adinkra $(V,E,c,\mu,h)$ with $p+q$ colors, and two grading functions $h_L:V\to \ZZ$ and $h_R:V\to \ZZ$ so that
\begin{itemize}
\item $h(v)=h_L(v)+h_R(v)$
\item Let $(v,w)\in E$.  If $c(v,w)\le p$ then $(v,w)$ is called a left-moving edge; if $c(v,w)>p$ then it is called a right-moving edge.
\item if $(v,w)$ is a left-moving edge, then $|h_L(v)-h_L(w)|=1$ and $h_R(v)=h_R(w)$.  If $(v,w)$ is a right-moving edge, then $|h_R(v)-h_R(w)|=1$ and $h_L(v)=h_L(w)$.
\end{itemize}

See Figure~\ref{fig:2d-example} for an example of a $2$-d Adinkra.

\end{center}
\end{figure}


\section{Products}
\label{sec:products}

It is also desirable to have some way of combining Adinkras to make bigger ones (and conversely, breaking down bigger ones into smaller pieces). These considerations induce us to consider products of Adinkras. It turns out that one way to get $2$-d Adinkras is to take a product of two $1$-d Adinkras, where the first Adinkra gives the left-moving colors and the second Adinkra gives the right-moving colors. We will eventually see in the next section that this operation (plus a quotient) is all we need to characterize a $2$-d Adinkra.

\begin{construction}
\label{const:product}
Let $p$ and $q$ be non-negative integers.  Let $A_1=(V_1, E_1, c_1, \mu_1,h_1)$ be a $1$-d Adinkra with $p$ colors and let $A_2=(V_2, E_2, c_2, \mu_2,h_2)$ be a $1$-d Adinkra $q$ colors.  We define the \emph{product} of these Adinkras $A_1\times A_2$ as the following 2-Adinkra with $(p,q)$ colors:
\[A_1\times A_2=(V,E,c,\mu,h_1,h_2)\]
where $V=V_1\times V_2$ and there are two kinds of edges in $E$:
\begin{itemize}
\item For every $(v_1,v_2)\in E_1$ and $w\in V_2$, we have an edge $((v_1,w),(v_2,w))$ of color $c_1(v_1,v_2)$ and dashing $\mu_1(v_1,v_2)$
\item For every $(w_1,w_2)\in E_2$ and $v\in V_1$, we have an edge $((v,w_1),(v,w_2))$ of color $p+c_2(w_1,w_2)$ and dashing
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:dashprodshift}
\mu_2(w_1,w_2)+h_1(v)
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
 See Figure~\ref{fig:product} for an example.
\end{construction}

\caption{Constructing the $2$-d Adinkra from two smaller $1$-d Adinkras. Note that the dashings are all ``consistent'' with the smaller Adinkras, except for the right-moving edges on the upper-left ``boundary'' of the rectangle; these correspond to right-moving edges where the grading corresponding to the first adinkra has height $1$.\label{fig:product}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The main non-obvious part of the definition is (\ref{eqn:dashprodshift}) for the dashings. The naive approach, assigning $\mu((v,w_1), (v,w_2)) = \mu_2(w_1, w_2)$, would fail to give us the odd parity we desire. This situation is analogous to assigning signs in the differential to a double chain complex, such as in Bott and Tu \cite{bott_tu}, where one would have to do a similar symmetry breaking. We now show that this sign-tweaking in fact gives an admissable dashing:

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:product-admissable}
Given Adinkras $A_1$ and $A_2$, $\mu$ is an admissible dashing for $A_1\times A_2$.  That is, given colors $c_1$ and $c_2$, and vertices $v$, $w$, $x$, and $y$ in $A_1\times A_2$, with edges $(v,w)$, $(w,x)$, $(x,y)$, and $(y,v)$ and colors $c(v,w)=c(x,y)=c_1$ and $c(w,x)=c(y,v)=c_2$, we have $\mu(v,w)+\mu(w,x)+\mu(x,y)+\mu(y,v)\equiv 1 \pmod{2}$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
If $c_1$ and $c_2$ are both left-moving colors, then write $v=(v_1,z)$.  Then $w=(w_1,z)$, $x=(x_1,z)$, and $y=(y_1,z)$.  Then we have
\[\mu(v,w)+\mu(w,x)+\mu(x,y)+\mu(y,v)
= \mu_1(v_1,w_1)+\mu_1(w_1,x_1)+\mu_1(x_1,y_1)+\mu_1(y_1,v_1)\]
and the result follows from the fact that $\mu_1$ was an admissible dashing on $A_1$.

If $c_1$ and $c_2$ are both right-moving colors, then write $v=(z,v_2)$.  Then $w=(z,w_2)$, $x=(z,x_2)$, and $y=(z,y_2)$.  Then
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\mu(v,w)+\mu(w,x)+\mu(x,y)+\mu(y,v)\\
&=& \mu_2(v_1,w_1)+h_1(z)+\mu_2(w_1,x_1)+h_1(z)+\mu_2(x_1,y_1)+h_1(z)+\mu_2(y_1,v_1)+h_1(z)
\end{eqnarray*}
which modulo $2$ is the same as 
\[\mu_2(v_1,w_1)+\mu_2(w_1,x_1)+\mu_2(x_1,y_1)+\mu_2(y_1,v_1).\]
The result follows from the fact that $\mu_2$ was an admissible dashing on $A_2$.


Now if $c_1$ is left-moving and $c_2$ is right-moving, then write $v=(v_1,v_2)$.  Then $w=(w_1,v_2)$, $x=(w_1,x_2)$, and $y=(v_1,x_2)$.  Now note that $v_1$ and $w_1$ are connected by an edge in $A_1$, so $h_1(v_1)$ and $h_1(v_2)$ differ by 1.  In particular, one of these is even and the other is odd.  Without loss of generality, suppose $h_1(v_1)$ is even.  Then $\mu(v,w)=\mu_1(v_1,w_1)$, $\mu(w,x)=\mu_2(v_2,x_2)+1$, $\mu(x,y)=\mu_1(w_1,v_1)$, and $\mu(y,v)=\mu_2(x_2,v_2)$, and we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\mu_(v,w)+\mu(w,x)+\mu(x,y)+\mu(y,v)\\
&=&\mu_1(v_1,w_1)+\mu_2(v_2,x_2)+1+\mu_1(w_1,v_1)+\mu_2(x_2,v_2)\equiv 1\pmod{2}.
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{proof}

We have shown that our definition of product creates a legitimate $2$-d Adinkra from two $1$-d Adinkras. Recall that Adinkras correspond to linear codes; it is natural to expect that the codes of the relevant Adinkras are related nicely.

\begin{definition}[Extending codes]
Let $p$ and $q$ be non-negative integers and let $n=p+q$.  Define $Z_L:\ZZ_2^p\to\ZZ_2^n$ to be the function that appends $q$ zeros, so that for instance, if $p=4$ and $q=3$, then $Z_L(1011)=1011000$.  Likewise, define $Z_R:\ZZ_2^q\to\ZZ_2^n$ to be the function that prepends $p$ zeros.  Note that $Z_L$ is a right-inverse of $\pi_L$ and $Z_R$ is a right-inverse of $\pi_R$.

Our most common use of this notation is as follows: if $C$ is a binary block code of length $p$, we write $Z_L(C)$ for the image under $Z_L$.  Likewise, if $C'$ is a binary block code of length $q$, we write $Z_R(C)$ for the image under $Z_R$.
\end{definition}

\begin{prop}
Let $A_1$ and $A_2$ be as above.  Then
\[C(A_1\times A_2)=Z_L(C(A_1))\oplus Z_R(C(A_2)).\]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let $(v_1,v_2)\in A_1\times A_2$.  Let $\vec{x}\in \ZZ_2^N$.  We can write $\vec{x}=\vec{x}_L+\vec{x}_R$ where $\vec{x}_L$ is zero in the last $q$ bits and $\vec{x}_R$ is zero in the first $p$ bits.  Now
\[\vec{x}(v_1,v_2)=(\vec{x}_L+\vec{x}_R)(v_1,v_2)=(\vec{x}_Lv_1,\vec{x}_Rv_2).\]
This means that $\vec{x}(v_1,v_2)=(v_1,v_2)$ if and only if $\vec{x}_Lv_1=v_1$ and $\vec{x}_R v_2=v_2$. So $\vec{x}\in C(A_1\times A_2)$ if and only if $\vec{x}_L\in Z_L(C(A_1))$ and $\vec{x}_R\in Z_R(C(A_2))$.
\end{proof}


\section{Every $2$-d Adinkra is a Quotient of a Vertex-switched Product}
\label{sec:quotient}

\com{We need to define $A_L$ and $A_R$ first}
\com{Explain that $K$ is not uniquely defined but is $C/C'$}
In Section~\ref{sec:products}, we showed that we can construct a $2$-d Adinkra by a product construction of two $1$-d Adinkras, each of which appears on the boundary of the product. In this section, we settle a conjecture of H\"ubsch \cite{hubsch:weaving} by showing that every $2$-d Adinkra is in fact a quotient of the the product of the two $1$-d Adinkras on its lower boundary. Our main result is:

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:quotient}
Let $A$ be a connected $2$-d Adinkra.  Fix a vertex $\overline{0}$ in $A$ and let $A_L^0$ (resp. $A_R^0$) be the connected component of $A_L$ (resp. $A_R$) containing $\overline{0}$. Then there exists a binary linear block code $K$, and a vertex switch $F$ so that there is a distant action of $K$ on $F(A_L^0\times A_R^0)$ that preserves colors, dashing, and bigrading, and so that
\[F(A_L^0\times A_R^0)/K\cong A\]
as an isomorphism of $2$-d Adinkras (that is, as an isomorphism of graphs that preserves colors, dashing, and bigrading).  Furthermore
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:kcomplement}
C(A)=Z_L(C(A_L^0))\oplus Z_R(C(A_R^0))\oplus K
\end{equation}
as an internal direct sum.
\end{thm}


Theorem \ref{thm:quotient} is very powerful; we immediately know a lot about what a $2$-d Adinkra must look like. Let the \emph{support} of a $2$-d Adinkra (and/or its bigrading function $(h_L,h_R)$) be defined as the range of $(h_L,h_R)$, its bigrading function. Then:
\begin{cor}
\label{cor:rectangle}
Let $A$ be a connected $2$-d Adinkra.  The support of $A$ is a rectangle.  That is, there exist integers $x_0$, $x_1$, $y_0$, and $y_1$ such that the support is
\[\{(i,j)\in\ZZ^2\,|\,x_0 \le i\le x_1\mbox{ and }y_0\le j\le y_1\}.\] All connected components of $A_L$ (and respectively $A_R$) are isomorphic as graded posets.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
Since $A_L^0$ is a connected $1$-d Adinkra and edges change $h_L$ by 1, there are integers $x_0$ and $x_1$ so that the range of the grading is $\{i\,|\,x_0\le i\le x_1\}$.  Likewise $A_R^0$ has a range of grading $\{j\,|\,y_0\le j\le y_1\}$ for some integers $y_0$ and $y_1$.

By Construction~\ref{const:product}, the support of $A_L^0\times A_R^0$ is
\[\{(i,j)\,|\,x_0\le i\le x_1\mbox{ and }y_0\le j\le y_1\}.\]
Since $\Phi$ preserves the bigrading, this is the support of $A$ as well.


Let $A' = A_L^0 \times A_R^0$. All connected components of $A'_L$ (resp. $A'_R$) are isomorphic to $A_L^0$ (resp. $A_R^0$). \com{The following is not convincing.  KI}  Quotients preserve connected components and act the same way on each component, so all of the connected components of $A_L$ (resp. $A_R$) must be as well.
\end{proof}

To prove Theorem~\ref{thm:quotient}, we first prove the existence of $K$ satisfying (\ref{eqn:kcomplement}).  We then construct a color and bigrading preserving graph isomorphism
\[\tilde{\Phi}:(A_L^0\times A_R^0)/K\to A.\]
Finally we identify the vertex switching $F$ that proves the theorem.

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:cplus}
\[Z_L(C(A_L^0))\oplus Z_R(C(A_R^0)) \subseteq C(A).\]
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Let $g\in Z_L(C(A_L^0))$ and $h\in Z_R(C(A_R^0))$.  Then $g\overline{0}=\overline{0}$ because applying $g$ to $\overline{0}$ results in a path that lies completely inside $A_L^0$, and so the fact that $g\overline{0}=\overline{0}$ in $A_L^0$ (since $g\in Z_L(C(A_L^0))$) results in $g\overline{0}=\overline{0}$ in $A$.  Likewise $h\overline{0}=\overline{0}$.  So $(g+h)\overline{0}=g(h(\overline{0}))=\overline{0}$ and $g+h\in C(A)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:existk}
There exists a binary linear block code $K$ so that
\[C(A)=Z_L(C(A_L^0))\oplus Z_R(C(A_R^0))\oplus K.
\]
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
From Lemma~\ref{lem:cplus} and basic linear algebra, there exists a vector subspace $K$ of $\ZZ_2^n$ that is a vector space complement of
$Z_L(C(A_L^0))\oplus Z_R(C(A_R^0))$ in $C(A)$.  That is,
\[C(A)=Z_L(C(A_L^0))\oplus Z_R(C(A_R^0))\oplus K.\]
\end{proof}


\begin{lem}
\label{lem:mainepicolors}
There is a graph epimorphism
\[\Phi:A_L^0\times A_R^0 \to A\]
that preserves colors and sends $(\overline{0},\overline{0})$ to $\overline{0}$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Recall that every connected Adinkra is the quotient of $I^n$ by the code for the Adinkra.\cite{d2l:omni}  So we have
\[A\cong I^n/C(A)\]
and
\[A_L^0\times A_R^0 \cong I^n/(Z_L(C(A_L^0))\oplus Z_R(C(A_R^0))).\]
In particular, we have a color-preserving graph epimorphism
\[\hat{\Phi}:I^n\to A\]
that sends $\vec{0}=(0,\ldots,0)$ to $\overline{0}$, and a color-preserving graph epimorphism
\[\pi:I^n\to A_L^0\times A_R^0,\]
with $\pi(\vec{0})=(\overline{0},\overline{0})$.

Since $Z_L(C(A_L^0))\oplus Z_R(C(A_R^0))\subset C(A)$, the map $\hat{\Phi}$ factors through $\pi$ to produce a color-preserving graph epimorphism
\[\Phi:A_L^0\times A_R^0\to A,\]
where $\Phi\circ\pi=\hat{\Phi}$.
\end{proof}

%The following used to be part of the proof of color preserving.
\begin{comment}
Suppose $i$ is a color and $(v_1,v_2)\in A_L^0\times A_R^0$ with $v_1=\vec{x}_1\overline{0}$ and $v_2=\vec{x}_2\overline{0}$.  Let $\vec{e}_i$ be the vector that has a single $1$ in the $i$th bit and $0$s elsewhere, so that for all vertices $v$, $\vec{e}_i v=q_i(v)$.  Using Lemma~\ref{lem:gphi}, we see that $\Phi(\vec{e}(v_1,v_2))=\vec{e}\Phi(v_1,v_2)$, so $\Phi$ sends edges of color $i$ to edges of color $i$.
\end{comment}

It will be useful to have the following result:
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:gphi}
If $g\in \ZZ_2^n$, then
\[\Phi(g(v_1,v_2))=g\Phi(v_1,v_2).\]
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Let $\vec{x}_1\in \ZZ_2^p$ be such that $\vec{x}_1\overline{0}=v_1$ in $A_L^0$ and $\vec{x}_2\in \ZZ_2^q$ be such that $\vec{x}_2\overline{0}=v_2$ in $A_R^0$.  Then $\pi_L(g)v_1 = \pi_L(g)\vec{x}_1\overline{0}=(\pi_L(g)+\vec{x}_1)\overline{0}$ and likewise $\pi_R(g)v_2=(\pi_R(g)+\vec{x}_2)\overline{0}$.  Then
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Phi(g(v_1,v_2))&=&\Phi(\pi_L(g)v_1,\pi_R(g)v_2)\\
&=&(Z_L(\pi_L(g)+\vec{x}_1)+Z_R(\pi_R(g)+\vec{x}_2))\overline{0}\\
&=&(g+Z_L(\vec{x}_1)+Z_R(\vec{x}_2))\overline{0}\\
&=&g(Z_L(\vec{x}_1)+Z_R(\vec{x}_2))\overline{0}\\
&=&g\Phi(v_1,v_2)
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:phisides}
For all $v\in A_L^0$, $\Phi(v,\overline{0})=v$, and for all $w\in A_R^0$, $\Phi(\overline{0},w)=w$.  In particular, $\Phi$ restricted to $A_L^0\times\{\overline{0}\}$ is an isomorphism onto its image, and likewise for $\Phi$ restricted to $\{\overline{0}\}\times A_R^0$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Let $\vec{x}\in \ZZ_2^p$ be such that $\vec{x}\overline{0}=v$.  By Lemma~\ref{lem:gphi}, $\Phi(v,0) = \Phi(Z_L(\vec{x})(\overline{0},\overline{0})) = Z_L(\vec{x})\Phi(\overline{0})=v$.  The proof for $w$ is similar.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:mainepibigrading}
The graph epimorphism $\Phi$ preserves the bigrading.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Let $(v_1,v_2)\in A_L^0\times A_R^0$ with $v_1=\vec{x}_1\overline{0}$ and $v_2=\vec{x}_2\overline{0}$. 
\begin{eqnarray*}
h_L(\Phi(v_1,v_2)) &=& h_L((Z_L(\vec{x}_1)+Z_R(\vec{x}_2))\overline{0})\\
 &=& h_L(Z_R(\vec{x}_2)Z_L(\vec{x}_1)\overline{0})\\
\end{eqnarray*}
Since $Z_R(\vec{x}_2)$ follows right-moving colors, this does not affect $h_L$, and so the above is
\[h_L(Z_L(\vec{x}_1)\overline{0}).\]
Since $Z_L(\vec{x}_1)\overline{0}$ in $A$ is the same as $\vec{x}_1\overline{0}$ in $A_L^0$, we have that this is $h(v_1)$.  On the other hand, in $A_L^0\times A_R^0$, this is $h_L(v_1,v_2)$.

Therefore $\Phi$ preserves $h_L$.  The fact that it preserves $h_R$ is proved similarly.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:kgrading}
If $\vec{x}\in K$, and $(v_1,v_2)\in A_L^0\times A_R^0$, then $\vec{x}(v_1,v_2)$ has the same bigrading as $(v_1,v_2)$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
This follows from Lemma~\ref{lem:mainepibigrading} and the fact that $K\subset C(A)$, so if $\vec{x}\in K$, then $\vec{x}\Phi(v_1,v_2)=\Phi(v_1,v_2)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
\label{cor:kquotient}
The code $K$ acts on $A_L^0\times A_R^0$ so that $(A_L^0\times A_R^0)/K$ is a well-defined $2$-d Adinkra without dashing: that is, a graph with colors and bigrading, satisfying the conditions of a $2$-d Adinkra except those that refer to dashing.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
Since $K\subset \ZZ_2^n$, it acts on $A_L^0\times A_R^0$ via color-preserving graph isomorphisms.  Since $K\subset C(A)$ which is doubly even, ...\com{fill in detail here}
By \cite{zhang:adinkras}, this is a well-defined quotient...
The colors descend from $A_L^0\times A_R^0$ to $(A_L^0\times A_R^0)/K$

By Lemma~\ref{lem:kgrading}, the bigrading on $A_L^0\times A_R^0$ descends to $(A_L^0\times A_R^0)/K$.
\end{proof}



\begin{lem}
\label{lem:isocolor}
The map $\Phi$ descends to a map
\[\tilde{\Phi}:(A_L^0\times A_R^0)/K\to A\]
which is a color-preserving graph isomorphism that preserves the bigrading.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $\vec{x}\in C(A)$ and let $w=\vec{x}v$.  Then $\Phi(w)=\Phi(\vec{x}v)=\Phi(v)$.  Therefore $\Phi$ descends to $\tilde{\Phi}$.

Suppose $v$ and $w$ are such that $\Phi(v)=\Phi(w)$.  Then there is a $\vec{x}$ so that $\vec{x}v=w$.  So $\Phi(w)=\Phi(\vec{x}v)=\vec{x}\Phi(v)=\vec{x}\Phi(w)=\Phi(\vec{x}w)$ so that $\vec{x}\in C(A)$.  By Lemma~\ref{lem:existk}, we can write $\vec{x}=\vec{x}_0+\vec{x}_K$ where $\vec{x}_0\in Z_L(C(A_L^0))\oplus Z_R(C(A_R^0))$ and $\vec{x}_K\in K$.  Since $\vec{x}_0\in C(A_L^0\times A_R^0)$, we have $\vec{x}_0 v = v$.  Therefore $\vec{x}_K v= w$.  Therefore $\tilde{\Phi}$ is injective.

The fact that $\tilde{\Phi}$ is surjective follows from $\Phi$ being surjective.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
\label{cor:mainisocolorbigrading}
The map $\tilde{\Phi}$ is a color-preserving graph isomorphism that preserves the bigrading.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
This summarizes Lemma~\ref{lem:isocolor}, Lemma~\ref{lem:mainepibigrading}, and Lemma~\ref{lem:kgrading}.
\end{proof}



Unfortunately, it is too much to expect the dashing on $(A_L^0\times A_R^0)/K$ to agree with the dashing on $A$; it is also almost always false that the dashing on $A_L^0\times A_R^0$ is invariant under the quotienting action of $K$. However, if we allow the operation of \emph{vertex switching}, then we can basically accomplish these goals, giving $F$ of Theorem~\ref{thm:quotient}.

Consider the dashing $\mu$ on $A$.  This restricts to $A_L^0$ and $A_R^0$, and Construction~\ref{const:product} produces a dashing $\mu_1$ on $A_L^0\times A_R^0$.   The graph homomorphism
\[\Phi:A_L^0\times A_R^0\to A\]
pulls back the dashing $\mu$ to $\mu_2$ on $A_L^0\times A_R^0$. While $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ can be different, they agree on the following parts of the Adinkra:

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:agree-on-boundary}
The dashings $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ agree on $A_L^0\times \{\overline{0}\}$ and on $\{\overline{0}\}\times A_R^0$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
The construction of $\mu_1$ gives each edge in $A_L^0\times\{\overline{0}\}$ the same dashing as in $A_L^0$ under the association of every edge $(v,w)$ with $((v,\overline{0}),(w,\overline{0}))$.  Lemma~\ref{lem:phisides} shows that the same is true for $\mu_2$.  Therefore $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ agree on $A_L^0\times\{\overline{0}\}$.  Likewise for $\{0\}\times A_R^0$.
\end{proof}


\begin{lem}
\label{lem:cycles-switching-class}
Two dashings have the same parity on all cycles\footnote{This type of result has a natural reformulation with homological algebra, done in independent ways by the first author's work using cubical cohomology \cite{dil:cohomology} and the second author's work using CW-complexes \cite{zhang:adinkras}. In either formulation, having parities of $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ agree on cycles is equivalent to $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = 0$ in cohomology.} if and only if they belong to the same vertex switching class.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Let the dashings be $\mu$ and $\mu'$ on the Adinkra $A$. Since vertex switching preserves parity on any cycle, the ``if'' direction is trivial and it suffices to prove the other direction.

Assume $\mu$ and $\mu'$ have the same parity on all cycles. It suffices to prove the statement for $A$ connected, since we can repeat our argument on each connected component of $A$. Pick a spanning tree $T$ of $A$, and pick a vertex $v$ of $A$ to serve as the root. The choice of $v$ induces a map $d$ on the vertices of $A$ that associates to each vertex its distance from $v$ using just edges in $T$ (so $d(v) = 0$), which in turn induces a map on the edges of $T$ by associating to each edge $(x,y)$ the min of $d(x)$ and $d(y)$ (these two values are necessarily $1$ apart). We denote this value $d(x,y)$, which gives a partial ordering on the edges of $T$, which we also call $d$ by slight abuse of notation; to be precise, $d((x,y)) < d((x,y))$ in the ordering $d$ whenever $d(x,y) < d(x,y)$ in the edge function $d$.

Now, extend $d$ to a total ordering $d'$ on the edges of $T$. We claim that we can vertex switch $\mu$ such that $\mu$ agrees with $\mu'$ on $T$. Take the minimal edge $e$ (under $d'$) where the two dashings differ. $e = (x,y)$, where without loss of generality $d(y) > d(x)$. Note that vertex switching at $y$ cannot change the dashing on any of the edges $e < e'$ under the ordering $d'$, since otherwise $d(y)$ should have been assigned a smaller value. Thus, we can greedily vertex switch to make $\mu$ and $\mu'$ equal on $T$.

Finally, if $\mu$ and $\mu'$ are equal on $T$, consider any edge $e$ not in $T$. This edge completes at least one cycle with edges in $T$ (otherwise $T$ was not a minimal spanning tree). Since the two cycles have the same parity in $\mu$ and $\mu'$ by assumption and the dashings agree on all edges but $e$, $e$ must be dashed in the same way under the two dashings. Thus, the two dashings must actually agree on all edges, meaning the two original dashings are in the same vertex switching class.
% However, since $\mu$ and $\mu'$ agree on all cyclesminimal cycles, they agree on all cycles by Lemma~\ref{lem:minimal-cycles-to-all-cycles}, and in particular this cycle. 

\end{proof}




\begin{lem}
\label{lem:switch12}
The parities of $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ agree on every cycle of $A_L^0\times A_R^0$.

Hence, by the above lemma, there exists a vertex switching that sends $\mu_1$ to $\mu_2$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Let our cycle be $(v_0,v_1,\ldots,v_k)$ with $v_0=v_k$.  We first consider the case where $v_0=\overline{0}$.

For this proof, we define a \emph{color sequence} of a path to be the sequence of colors $(c(v_0,v_1),c(v_1,v_2),\ldots,c(v_{k-1},v_k))$ of edges along the path.  Note that given a starting vertex $v_0$ and a color sequence, there is a unique path that starts at $v_0$ with that color sequence.  This follows by applying induction to Property 2 of the definition of an Adinkra.

We begin with the color sequence for the cycle $(v_0,\ldots,v_k)$.  We will now describe a series of modifications to this cycle, described by modifying the color sequence.  The idea is to perform a ``bubble sort'', by iteratively swapping adjacent colors until the left-moving colors are all at the beginning and the right-moving colors are all at the end.

First, given a color sequence
\[(i_1,\ldots,i_{j-1},i_j,i_{j+1},i_{j+2},\ldots,i_k)\]
an adjacent swap results in a color sequence
\[(i_1,\ldots,i_{j-1},i_{j+1},i_j,i_{j+2},\ldots,i_k).\]
Modifying a color sequence in this way leads to a new path from $\overline{0}$.  The path is unchanged up to $v_{j-1}$, but by the definition of Adinkras, property 3, the path returns to $v_{j+1}$ so it is only $v_j$ that has changed.  Thus, the new path is still a cycle starting at $\overline{0}$.  The effect on the parity of any dashing is, by property 4, to add $1$ modulo $2$.  In particular, $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are both affected in the same way.

It is straightforward to find a series of adjacent swaps so that the left-moving colors are moved to the beginning of the color sequence.  Then the resulting path starts from $\overline{0}$, stays in $A_L^0\times\{0\}$, then follows right-moving edges, ending in $\overline{0}$.  Since the right-moving edges end in $\overline{0}$, it must be that the right-moving edges are in $\{0\}\times A_R^0$.  By Lemma~\ref{lem:agree-on-boundary}, $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are equal here, and so their parity on this modified path is the same.  Therefore, their parity on the original loop was the same.

Now we consider loops $p$ where $v_0\not=\overline{0}$.  Since $A_L^0\times A_R^0$ is connected, there is a path $p_0$ from $\overline{0}$ to $v_0$.  Take the path $p_0$, followed by $p$, then followed by $p_0^{-1}$ (meaning $p_0$ traversed in the opposite sense).  This is a loop starting and ending in $\overline{0}$, but the parity of a dashing is the same as that of $p$, since every new edge in $p_0$ is counterbalanced by a new edge in $p_0^{-1}$.  Therefore the parity of $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ agree on all loops.
\end{proof}


\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:quotient}]
Given a $2$-d Adinkra $A$, select a vertex $\overline{0}$ of $A$ and let $A_L^0$ and $A_R^0$ be the connected components of $A_L$ and $A_R$, respectively, that contain $\overline{0}$.  By Lemma~\ref{lem:existk}, there exists a binary linear block code $K$ so that
\[C(A)=Z_L(C(A_L^0))\oplus Z_R(C(A_R^0))\oplus K.
\]
Use Construction~\ref{const:product} to construct the $2$-d Adinkra $A_L^0\times A_R^0$ with dashing $\mu_1$.
By Lemma~\ref{lem:mainepicolors} and Lemma~\ref{lem:mainepibigrading}, there is a graph homomorphism
\[\Phi:A_L^0\times A_R^0 \to A\]
that preserves colors and bigrading.  If we take the dashing $\mu$ from $A$, and pull it back using $\Phi$ to a dashing $\mu_2$ on $A_L^0\times A_R^0$, then Lemma~\ref{lem:switch12} says that there exists a vertex switch $F$ sending $\mu_1$ to $\mu_2$.

By Corollary~\ref{cor:kquotient}, $K$ acts on $A_L^0\times A_R^0$ to produce a well-defined $2$-d Adinkra without dashing:
\[(A_L^0\times A_R^0)/K\]
and an isomorphism
\[\tilde{\Phi}:(A_L^0\times A_R^0)/K\to A\]
that preserves colors and the bigrading.  Since $\mu_2$ is invariant under $K$, there is a well-defined $2$-d Adinkra with dashing
\[F(A_L^0\times A_R^0)/K\]
Note that this is the same as $A_L^0\times A_R^0$ if we ignore dashing.  By Corollary~\ref{cor:mainisocolorbigrading}, this is isomorphic to $A$ as a graph with colors and bigrading.  Since $\mu_2$ is obtained by pulling back $\mu$ from $A$, this isomorphism preserves dashing as well.
\end{proof}



\section{ESDE Codes}

We have shown that each $2$-d Adinkra is constructed from a pair of $1$-d Adinkras plus a code; it is natural to ask which codes can appear. In this section, we classify these codes, which is another part of the conjectures of H\"ubsch \cite{hubsch:weaving}. 

\begin{definition}[Weights, ESDE codes]
Let $p$ and $q$ be non-negative integers so that $p+q=n$. For any $S \subset [n]$ and every element $\vec{x} \in \ZZ_2^n$, define $\wt_S(\vec{x})$ to be the number of $1$'s in the places corresponding to $S$; so in particular, $\wt_{[n]} = \wt$ as functions. Define an \emph{ESDE (even-split doubly-even) code of length $(p,q)$} to be a doubly-even code of length $n$ and a partition $L \cup R = [n]$ such that $|L| = p$, $|R| = q$, and every word $\vec{x}$ in the code has both $\wt_L(\vec{x})$ and $\wt_R(\vec{x})$ be even-valued. For our work, we always assume that $L = \{1, 2, \ldots, p\}$ and $R = \{p+1, p+2, \ldots, n\}$, since we can permute the indices without changing the structure of the code.
\end{definition}

We remark that ESDE codes are no more restrictive than doubly-even codes; an illustrative example is that any doubly-even code can be made into an ESDE code trivially by assigning $(p,q) = (n, 0)$ or $(0, n)$. This corresponds to the fact that any $1$-d Adinkra is trivially a $2$-d Adinkra with all colors left-moving or all colors right-moving. The main data in ESDE codes is the splitting. In fact, they are quite easy to classify:

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:esde}
Given a doubly-even $[n,k]$-code $C$, there is a bijection between codewords in $C^\perp$ and (ordered) paritions $L \cup R$ that make $C$ into an ESDE. There are $2^{n-k}$ such partitions. 
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Consider a partition $L \cup R$ that makes $C$ into an ESDE, and consider the codeword $w$ that is defined to have $1$ at all the positions in $L$ and $0$ at all the positions in $R$. By definition of ESDE codes, all codewords in $C$ have an even number of $1$'s in the support of $w$, which is equivalent to saying that $w$ is orthogonal to all the codewords in $C$. Thus, $w \in C^\perp$. Conversely, for any $w \in C^\perp$, $w$ is orthogonal to all codewords in $C$ and thus give an ESDE. Thus, there is a bijection between the two sets. Note these are ordered partitions; the codeword which has $1$ at all the positions in $R$ and $0$ otherwise would give the same paritition, but in reversed order.
\end{proof}


Recall\cite{d2l:omni,d2l:topology,d2l:decodes} that $1$-d chromotopologies are in bijection with quotients of the Hamming cube $I^n$ by a doubly-even code $K$, so any Adinkra $A$ has a well-defined associated code $C(A)$ that is uniquely determined by just the graph structure of the adinkra. Our goal is to show that ESDE codes are exactly the codes that appear for $2$-d adinkras.

In \cite{d2l:first,d2l:graph-theoretic}, there was a class of $1$-d Adinkras that were particularly easy to construct and study, called {\em Valise} Adinkras, whose height function had values in two adjacent integers (usually $0$ and $1$).  By analogy, given a ESDE code, we construct a $2$-d Adinkra called the {\em Valise 2-d Adinkra} that has support in a $2\times 2$ square.


\begin{construction}
\label{cons:valise}
Let $K$ be an ESDE code.  We will describe a construction that provides a $2$-d Adinkra with code $K$, called the {\em Valise 2-d Adinkra}. First, since $K$ is doubly-even, there exists a connected $1$-d Adinkra $A$ with code $C(A) = K$.\cite{d2l:omni,d2l:topology}  Fix a vertex $\overline{0}$ of $A$. Now every vertex $v$ corresponds to a vector $\vec{v} \pmod{K}$. Define $h_L(v) = \wt_L(\vec{v}) \pmod{2}$ and $h_R(v) = \wt_R(\vec{v}) \pmod{2}$. Note that these functions are well-defined since $K$ is ESDE. $(h_L, h_R)$ gives a bigrading to $A$, making it a $2$-d Adinkra. % Note t, h_R(v)) =    For every vertex $v$ of $A$, pick a path from $\overline{0}$ to $v$.  This produces a color sequence $d$.  Define $h_L(v)$ to be the number $\pmod{2}$ of left-moving colors in $d$ and likewise $h_R(v)$ is the number modulo 2 of right-moving colors in $d$.  These functions are well-defined if every path from $\overline{0}$ to $v$ has the same parity in number of left-moving colors and in number of right-moving colors.  This occurs if and only if every loop starting from $\overline{0}$ has an even number of left-moving colors and an odd number of right-moving colors.  If $K$ is ESDE, then this is the case.
\end{construction}

\caption{A valise $2$-d adinkra that cannot be put into non-valise form.\label{fig:tight valise}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:esde}
For a code $K \subset \ZZ_2^n$, there exists a $2$-d adinkra $A$ with $C(A) = K$ if and only if $K$ is a ESDE code.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $C(A) = K$ for some $2$-d Adinkra $A$. We know that $K$ is doubly-even. Consider any codeword $\alpha \in K$. Starting at $\overline{0} \in A$, moving by a path corresponding to $\alpha$ must end up back at $\overline{0}$. In particular, it must use an even number of left-moving (resp. right-moving) edges since each of such edge changes the $h_L$ (resp. $h_R$) by $1$ in absolute value. Thus, $C$ must be ESDE. 

Conversely, given an ESDE code $K$, we can use Construction~\ref{cons:valise} to get a $2$-d Adinkra with code $K$. By construction, $A$ is a $1$-d Adinkra with code $K$.  The only thing left to check is whether the $h_L$ and $h_R$ that are defined satisfy the correct properties on edges. Let $(v,w)$ be a left-moving edge in the Adinkra $A$.  Then the color of the edge is left-moving and so $h_L(v)\not=h_L(w)$ and $h_R(v)=h_R(w)$.  Since the possible values for $h_L$ and $h_R$ are $0$ and $1$, it follows that $|h_R(v)-h_R(w)|=1$. The proof is similar for right-moving edges.

\end{proof}

Given a $2$-d Adinkra $A$, with special basepoint $\overline{0}$ and corresponding $A_L^0$ and $A_R^0$, there remains the question of finding the code $K$.  Recall that
\[C(A)=Z_L(C(A_L^0))\oplus Z_R(C(A_R^0))\oplus K.\]
There is some choice involved in defining $K$; it merely has to be a vector space complement to
\[C'=Z_L(C(A_L^0))\oplus Z_R(C(A_R^0)).\]
$K$ will more naturally be defined as $C(A)/C'$, though computationally we can choose a representative to be $K$.


Let $V^0=A_L^0\cap A_R^0$.  Now for every $v\in V^0$, we have $h_L(v)=h_L(\overline{0})$ and $h_R(v)=h_R(\overline{0})$ so in particular, $V^0$ has no edges; only vertices.

We construct a bijection between $V^0$ and $C(A)/C'$.

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:findk}
The map
\[\Psi:C(A)/C'\to V^0\]
given by
\[\Psi(\vec{x})=\pi_L(\vec{x})\overline{0}\]
is a bijection.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
If $\vec{x}\in C(A)$, then $(\pi_L(\vec{x})+\pi_R(\vec{x}))\overline{0}=\overline{0}$, so $\pi_L(\vec{x})\overline{0}=\pi_R(\vec{x})\overline{0}$.  So $\Psi(\vec{x})\in A_L^0\cap A_R^0=V^0$.  This map is invariant under $C'$, so $\Psi$ is well-defined.

Suppose $\Psi(\vec{x})=\Psi(\vec{y})$.  Then $\pi_L(\vec{x})\overline{0}=\pi_L(\vec{y})\overline{0}$.  Therefore $\pi_L(\vec{x}+\vec{y})\in C(A_L^0)$.  Likewise $\pi_R(\vec{x}+\vec{y})\in C(A_R^0)$.  So $\vec{x}+\vec{y}\in C'$.
\end{proof}

\section{Enumerating $2$-d Adinkras}
As a final illustration that we have characterized all $2$-d Adinkras, note that the constructions so far suffice to enumerate all $2$-d Adinkras.

\begin{construction}
First choose an ESDC code $C$.  Let $\pi_L:\ZZ_2^n\to\ZZ_2^p$ and $\pi_R:\ZZ_2^n\to\ZZ_2^q$ be projections onto the first $p$ and last $q$ bits, respectively.

Use the construction from \cite{d2l:omni,d2l:topology} to create the $1$-d Adinkra $A=I^n/C$ with code $C$.  Use the splitting of $[n]$ to designate some edges left-moving and the others, right-moving.  Fix a vertex $\overline{0}$ in $A$.  Let $A_L^0$ and $A_R^0$ be as above. \com{Refer to specific construction}  Use the ``hanging gardens'' construction in Ref.~\cite{d2l:graph-theoretic} on $A_L^0/\pi_L(C)$ and pull it back to $A_L^0$ to create a height function $\tilde{h}_L$ on $A_L^0$ that is invariant under $\pi_L(C)$.  Likewise create a height function $\tilde{h}_R$ on $A_R^0$ invariant under $\pi_R(C)$.

Now extend $\tilde{h}_L$ to a grading $h_L$ on the rest of $A$ as follows: for every vertex $v$ of $A$, let $\vec{x}\in \ZZ_2^n$ be such that $\vec{x}\overline{0}=v$.  Write $\vec{x}=\vec{x}_L+\vec{x}_R$ where $\vec{x}_L$ is zero in the last $q$ bits and $\vec{x}_R$ is zero in the first $p$ bits.  Then $v_L=\vec{x}_L\overline{0}\in A_L^0$.  Define $h_L(v)=\tilde{h}_L(v_L)$.  Likewise $v_R=\vec{x}_R\overline{0}\in A_R^0$.  Define $h_R(v)=\tilde{h}_R(v_R)$.
\end{construction}

The fact that the result is a $2$-d Adinkra follows from the following results.

\begin{lem}
The gradings $h_L$ and $h_R$ defined above are independent of $\vec{x}$.\label{lem:indep}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ have $\vec{x}\overline{0}=\vec{y}\overline{0}$.  Then $\vec{y}-\vec{x}\in C$.  Since $\tilde{h}_L$ is invariant under $\pi_L(C)$, we have that $\tilde{h}_L(\vec{y}_L\overline{0})=\tilde{h}_L(\vec{x}_L\overline{0})$.  So $h_L$ is independent of $\vec{x}$.  Likewise for $h_R$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
If $v$ and $v'$ are vertices and $(v,v')$ is a left-moving edge, then
$|h_L(v)-h_L(v')|=1$ and $h_R(v)=h_R(v')$.  If $(v,v')$ is a right-moving edge, then $|h_R(v)-h_R(v')|=1$ and $h_L(v)=h_L(v')$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Let $v$ and $v'$ be vertices connected by an edge of color $i$.  Let $\vec{x}$ be such that $\vec{x}\overline{0}=v$.  Write $\vec{x}=\vec{x}_L+\vec{x}_R$ where $\vec{x}_L$ is zero in the last $q$ bits and $\vec{x}_R$ is zero in the first $p$ bits.  Let $w=\vec{x}_L\overline{0}$.  Then $\vec{x}_R w = v$ so $h_L(v)=h_L(w)$.

Supppose the color $i$ is right-moving.  Then $\vec{e}_i v = v'$ and $h_L(v')=\tilde{h}_L(\pi_L(\vec{x}+\vec{e}_i)\overline{0})=\tilde{h}_L(\pi_L(\vec{x}))=h_L(v)$.


Now suppose the color $i$ is left-moving.  Let $w'=q_i(w)$.  Then 
$h_L(w')=\tilde{h}_L((\vec{x}_L+\vec{e}_i)\overline{0})=h_L(v')$.  Both $w'$ and $w$ are in $A_L^0$, so $|h_L(w)-h_L(w')|=1$.  Since $h_L(w')=h_L(v')$ and $h_L(w)=h_L(v)$, we conclude that $|h_L(v)-h_L(v')|=1$.

The other cases can be obtained by symmetry.
\end{proof}


\begin{thm}
Every $2$-d Adinkra can obtained by this construction.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Given any $2$-d Adinkra $A$, there is an ESDC code $C$.  Pick a vertex $\overline{0}$ and define $A_L^0$ and $A_R^0$ as in (\ref{thm:quotient}).

Restrict the gradings $h_L$ and $h_R$ onto $A_L^0$ and $A_R^0$.  Note that if $g\in C$, then $\pi_L(g)v=\pi_R(g)v$, and so $h_L(\pi_L(g)v)=h_L(v)$ and $h_R(\pi_L(g)v)=h_R(v)$.  Therefore $h_L$ restricted to $A_L^0$ is invariant under $\pi_L$.  Likewise $h_R$ restricted to $A_R^0$ is invariant under $\pi_R$.

The dashings, as described in \cite{d2l:topology}, can be obtained by choosing the specific quotient $I^n/C$.

Theorem~\ref{thm:quotient} gives a description of $A$ in terms of this construction.

\end{proof}

\section{Representations of supersymmetry}
\label{app:repn}
The $1$-d $n$-extended supersymmetry algebra is a superalgebra consisting of an even operator $H$ and $n$ odd operators $Q_1, \ldots, Q_n$ with the following relations:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:susy1d1}
[H,Q_i]&=&0\\
\label{eqn:susy1d2}
\{Q_i,Q_j\}&=&2\delta_{ij}H
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{construction}
\label{cons:susy1d}
Given a $1$-d Adinkra $A=(V,E,c,\mu,h)$ with $n$ colors, we can find a representation $R(A)$ of the $1$-d $n$-extended supersymmetry algebra as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $R_0$ be the real vector space generated by $V$.  That is, $R_0$ is the set $\{f:V\to \RR\}$ viewed as a vector space with function addition and scalar multiplication.  There is a basis given by $\{b_v\,|\,v\in V\}$ with $b_v(v)=1$ and $b_v(w)=0$ if $v\not=w$.
\item Let $R(A)=R_0\otimes_\RR \RR[H]$.  This is a representation of $\RR[H]$ with $H(b\otimes H^k)=b\otimes H^{k+1}$, and $H$ extends to all of $R$ linearly.
\item If $v\in V$ and $w=q_i(v)$, then
\[Q_i(b_v\otimes H^k)=(-1)^{\mu(v,w)} b_w\otimes H^{k+\frac12(1-h(w)+h(v))}\]
Extend $Q_i$ to all of $R(A)$ linearly.
\item There is a $\ZZ_2$ grading of $R(A)$: let the $\ZZ_2$ grading of $b_v\otimes H^k$ be $h(v)\pmod{2}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{construction}
Note that the exponent of $H$, $i+\frac12(1-h(w)+h(v))$, is an integer because $|h(w)-h(v)|=1$.

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:rep1}
$R$ is a representation of the $1$-d supersymmetry algebra.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
First note that each $Q_i$ acts by changing the $\ZZ_2$ grading and $H$ does not.  Therefore the $Q_i$ are odd operators and $H$ is an even operator.

Since $b_v$ is a basis for $R_0$, $b_v\otimes 1$ is a generator of $R$ as an $\RR[H]$-module.  It suffices, then, to prove (\ref{eqn:susy1d1})--(\ref{eqn:susy1d2}) for $b_v\otimes 1$.

If $q_i(v)=w$, then
\begin{eqnarray*}
Q_i(H(b_v\otimes H^k))&=&Q_i(b_v\otimes H^{k+1})\\
&=&(-1)^{\mu(v,w)}b_w\otimes H^{k+1+\frac12(1-h(w)+h(v))}\\
&=&H((-1)^{\mu(v,w)}b_w\otimes H^{k+\frac12(1-h(w)+h(v))})\\
&=&H(Q_i(b_v\otimes H^k))
\end{eqnarray*}

We also have
\begin{eqnarray*}
Q_i(Q_i(b_v\otimes H^k))
&=&Q_i((-1)^{\mu(v,w)} b_w\otimes H^{k+\frac12(1-h(w)+h(v))})\\
&=&(-1)^{\mu(v,w)} (-1)^{\mu(w,v)} b_v\otimes H^{k+\frac12(1-h(w)+h(v))+\frac12(1-h(v)+h(w))}\\
&=&b_v\otimes H^{k+1}\\
&=&H(b_v\otimes H^{k})
\end{eqnarray*}

Now consider $\{Q_i,Q_j\}$ where $i\not=j$.  Let $w=q_i(v)$ and $x=q_j(w)$ and $y=q_i(x)$.  Then from Property 3 of Adinkras, $v=q_j(y)$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
Q_i(Q_j(b_v\otimes H^k))
&=&Q_i((-1)^{\mu(v,y)}b_y\otimes H^{k+\frac12(1-h(y)+h(v))})\\
&=&(-1)^{\mu(v,y)+\mu(y,x)}b_x\otimes H^{k+\frac12(1-h(y)+h(v))+\frac12(1-h(x)+h(y))})\\
&=&(-1)^{\mu(v,y)+\mu(y,x)}b_x\otimes H^{k+\frac12(2-h(x)+h(v))})
\end{eqnarray*}
while
\begin{eqnarray*}
Q_j(Q_i(b_v\otimes H^k))
&=&Q_j((-1)^{\mu(v,w)}b_w\otimes H^{k+\frac12(1-h(w)+h(v))})\\
&=&(-1)^{\mu(v,w)+\mu(w,x)}b_x\otimes H^{k+\frac12(1-h(w)+h(v))+\frac12(1-h(x)+h(w))})\\
&=&(-1)^{\mu(v,w)+\mu(w,x)}b_x\otimes H^{k+\frac12(2-h(x)+h(v))})
\end{eqnarray*}
Since
\[\mu(v,w)+\mu(w,x)+\mu(x,y)+\mu(y,v)\equiv 2\pmod{2},\]
we have
\[Q_jQ_i(b_v\otimes H^k)=-Q_iQ_j(b_v\otimes H^k).\]
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Adinkraic representations]
A representation $M$ of $1$-d $n$-extended supersymmetry algebra is called \emph{adinkraic} if there exists a $1$-d Adinkra $A$ with $n$ colors so that $R(A)=M$ in Construction~\ref{cons:susy1d}.
\end{definition}

Though not relevant for our theorems, one can notice that the grading $h$ provides a grading to $R$ in the following way: the mass dimension of $b_v\otimes H^k$ is $k+\frac12 h(v)$.  Then $H$ has grading $1$ and each $Q_i$ has grading $\frac12$.

\subsection{Representations of $2$-d supersymmetry}
The $2$-d $(p,q)$-extended supersymmetry algebra has two even operators $H$ and $P$, and $n$ odd operators $Q_1,\ldots, Q_n$, with the first $p$ being viewed as ``left-moving'' and the remaining $q=n-p$ being viewed as ``right-moving''.  $H$ and $P$ commute with everything, while
\[
\{Q_i, Q_j\}=\begin{cases}
2\delta_{ij}(H+ P),&\mbox{ if $i\le p$}\\
2\delta_{ij}(H- P),&\mbox{ if $i> p$}\\
\end{cases}
\]
We define $P_- = H+ P$ and $P_+=H-P$.

\begin{construction}
Given a $2$-d Adinkra $A=(V,E,c,\mu,h_L,h_R)$ with $(p,q)$ colors, we get a representation of the $2$-d $(p,q)$-extended supersymmetry algebra as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $R_0=\{f:V\to\RR\}$ as a vector space.  Again, for every $v\in V$ define $b_v(v)=1$ and $b_v(w)=0$ if $v\not=w$.
\item Let $R(A)=R_0\otimes_\RR \RR[P_-,P_+]$ as a free $\RR[P_-,P_+]$-module.
\item If $i\le p$, and $w=q_i(v)$, then define
\[Q_i(b_v\otimes P_-^k P_+^l)=
(-1)^{\mu(v,w)}b_w\otimes P_-^{k+\frac12(1-h_L(w)+h_L(v))}P_+^l \]
\item If $i>p$ then
\[Q_i(b_v\otimes P_-^k P_+^l)=
(-1)^{\mu(v,w)}b_w\otimes P_-^k P_+^{l+\frac12(1-h_L(w)+h_L(v))} \]
\item There is a $\ZZ_2$ grading of $R(A)$: let the $\ZZ_2$ grading of $b_v\otimes H^k$ be $h_L(v)+h_R(v)\pmod{2}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{construction}

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:rep2}
$R(A)$ is a representation of the $2$-d $(p,q)$-extended supersymmetry algebra.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
The proof is largely the same as Proposition~\ref{prop:rep1}.
\end{proof}

\begin{construction}
Let $R_L$ be a representation of $1$-d $p$-extended supersymmetry and $R_R$ be a representation of $1$-d $q$-extended supersymmetry.  Then we define
\[R_L\otimes R_R\]
a representation of $2$-d $(p,q)$ supersymmetry as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item For $i\le p$, $Q_i(a\otimes b)=Q_i(a)\otimes b$.
\item For $i>p$, $Q_i(a\otimes b)=(-1)^{|a|}a\otimes Q_{i-p} b$.
\item $H(a\otimes b)=H a\otimes b + a\otimes Hb$
\item $P(a\otimes b)=Pa \otimes b + a\otimes Pb$
\end{itemize}
Here $|a|$ means the $\ZZ_2$ grading of the element $a$ in $R_L$.
\end{construction}

\begin{prop}
$R_L\otimes R_R$ is a representation of $2$-d $(p,q)$-extended supersymmetry.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
This is standard in the SUSY literature.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
Let $A_L$ and $A_R$ be $1$-d Adinkras with $p$ and $q$ colors respectively.  Let $R(A_L)$ and $R(A_R)$ be the representations of $1$-d supersymmetry obtained from $A_L$ and $A_R$, respectively, by Construction~\ref{cons:susy1d}.  Then there is an isomorphism of representations of $2$-d $(p,q)$-extended supersymmetry
\[R(A_L)\otimes R(A_R) \cong R(A_L\times A_R)\]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let $v\in A_L$ and $w\in A_R$.  The isomorphism sends $(b_v\otimes H^k)\otimes (b_w\otimes H^l)$ to $b_{(v,w)}\otimes P_-^{k}P_+^l$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
Let $A$ be an Adinkra and let $v$ be a vertex of $A$.  Let $A'$ be the Adinkra obtained by doing a vertex flip on $v$.  Then there is an isomorphism from $R(A)$ and $R(A')$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let $\Phi$ be the linear map that sends $b_v\otimes H^k$ to $-b_v\otimes H^k$, and for every $w\not=v$, $b_w\otimes H^k$ to $b_w\otimes H^k$.

Let $w=q_i(v)$.  Now $Q_i(\Phi(b_v\otimes H^k))=Q_i(-b_v\otimes H^k)=-(-1)^{\mu(v,w)}b_w H^{k+\frac12(1-h(w)+h(v)}=(-1)^{\mu'(v,w)}b_w H^{k+\frac12(1-h(w)+h(v)}=\Phi(Q_i(b_v\otimes H^k))$.

etc. etc. [This is tedious.]
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
Let $A=(V,E,c,\mu,h_L,h_R)$ and $A'=(V,E,c,\mu,h_L,h_R)$ be $2$-d Adinkras and let $f:V\to V'$ be a graph homomorphism that preserves coloring, dashing, and gradings.  Then the linear map
\[f_*:R(A)\to R(A')\]
\[f_*(b_v\otimes P_-^kP_+^l)=b_{f(v)}\otimes P_-^kP_+^l\]
is a homomorphism of representations.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
The map $f_*$ commutes with $P_+$ and $P_-$.  If $i$ is a left-moving color and $q_i(v)=w$, then $q_i(f(v))=f(w)$ and
\[f_*(Q_i(b_v\otimes P_-^kP_+^l))=f_*((-1)^{\mu(v,w)}b_w\otimes P_-^{k+\frac12(1-h_L(w)+h_L(v))}P_+^l\]
while
\[Q_i(f_*(b_v\otimes P_-^kP_+^l))=Q_i(b_{v'}\otimes P_-^kP_+^l)
=(-1)^{\mu'(f(v),f(w))}b_{f(w)}\otimes P_-^{1-h'_L(f(w))-h'_R(f(v))}P_+^l\]
which is the same thing if $f$ preserves dashing and gradings.

Likewise if $i$ is a right-moving color.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
If $A$ is a $2$-d Adinkra with $(p,q)$ colors, then 
\[R(A)=(R(A_L^0)\otimes R(A_R^0))/M\]
where $M$ is a submodule.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
From the main theorem Theorem~\ref{thm:quotient},
\[A=(A_L^0\times A_R^0)/K\]
and in particular there is a graph homomorphism
\[f:A_L^0\times A_R^0\to A\]
that is surjective and preserves coloring, dashing, and gradings.  Take the coresponding linear map
\[f_*:R(A_L^0\times A_R^0)\to R(A)\]
and let $M$ be the kernel of this map.  Composed with the isomorphism
\[R(A_L^0)\otimes R(A_R^0)\cong R(A_L^0\times A_R^0)\]
we have the isomorphism.
\end{proof}


\section{Equivalence with other notions of $2$-d Adinkras}


If I read Tristan's stuff right, we can completely translate the combinatorial rules to: a \emph{2-d adinkra} (of dimension $n$) is a finite simple connected graph $A$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is an $1$-d adinkra (with the associated ranking, dashing, etc.).
\item It has $p + q = n$ colors, where the first $p$-colors are called ``left-moving'' and the second $q$-colors are called ``right-moving.''
\item A coherence condition: for any cycle, we imagine the following sum: going up (here ``up'' comes from the grading we have from the engineering dimension in our ranking for the $1$-d adinkra) a left-handed edge adds $-1$, and going up a right-handed edge adds $1$; going down the edges give contributions with opposite signs. The sum of this around any cycle must be $0$. (in particular, this rules out things like ambidextrous bow-ties)
\end{itemize} 

Assuming I interpreted these rules correctly, now I can do combinatorics without needing any physics.

The first structural fact we can impose is a bi-grading that is compatible with the grading we already have from the $1$-d adinkra structure, in the sense that the $1$-d grading is simply one of the coordinates of our bi-grading.

\begin{prop}
A $1$-d adinkra can be extended to a $2$-d adinkra if and only if the $1$-d adinkra has a \emph{bigrading} to $\ZZ^2$. This is a map $g: V \rightarrow \ZZ^2$, such that all left-moving edges correspond to displacements of $(0, 1)$ and right-moving edges correspond to displacements of $(1, 0)$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Proof delayed until talking more with Kevin and Tristan about the easiest way to write things up to avoid reinventing wheels.
\end{proof}
