\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{$1$-d Adinkras}
Adinkras in [references] will be referred to as $1$-d Adinkras in this paper, since they relate to supersymmetry in $1$ dimension.  We will review a definition of $1$-d Adinkras now.  Note that while it is conventional to specify a natural number $N$ to denote the number of supersymmetries, we break with convention and instead specify $C$, a set of $n$ different colors.

\begin{definition}
Let $n$ be a non-negative integer.  A $1$-d Adinkra with $n$ colors is $(V,E,c,\mu,g)$ where
\begin{itemize}
\item $(V,E)$ is a finite undirected graph (called the underlying graph of the Adinkra) with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E\subset V\times V$.
\item $c:E\to \{1,\ldots,n\}$ is a map called the coloring
\item $\mu:E\to \{1,-1\}$ is a map called the dashing
\item $h:V\to\ZZ$ is a map called the grading
\end{itemize}

These are required to satisfy the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $(v,w)\in E$, then $(w,v)\in E$.  Furthermore, $c(v,w)=c(w,v)$ and $\mu(v,w)=\mu(w,v)$.  Intuitively, the edges are undirected.
\item For every $v\in V$ and $c\in \{1,\ldots,n\}$, there exist exactly one $w\in V$ so that $(v,w)\in E$ and $c(v,w)=c$.
\item If $c_1$, $c_2\in \{1,\ldots,n\}$ with $c_1\not=c_2$, and $v\in V$, then there exist $w$, $x$, and $y\in V$ so that $(v,w)$, $(w,x)$, $(x,y)$, and $(y,v)\in E$, and $c(v,w)=c(x,y)=c_1$ and $c(w,x)=c(y,v)=c_2$ and $\mu(v,w)\mu(w,x)\mu(x,y)\mu(y,v)=-1$.
\item If $(v,w)\in E$, then $|h(v)-h(w)|=1$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
Note that in [Reference], there is also a bipartition of the vertices, where some vertices are represented by open circles and called bosons, and other vertices are represented by filled circles and called fermions.  This is not necessary to include in our definition, because a vertex $v$ is a boson if and only if $h(v)$ is even.

\subsection{The action of $\ZZ_2^n$ and the code}
Let $A$ be a $1$-d Adinkra with $n$ colors, with vertex set $V$.  For all $1\le i\le n$, define
\[q_i:V\to V\]
so that for all $v\in V$, $q_i(v)$ is the unique vertex joined to $v$ by an edge of color $i$.

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:qmap}
The map $q_i$ extends to a graph isomorphism from the underlying graph of $A$ to itself which preserves colors.  It is an involution and for all $i$, $j$, we have
\begin{equation}
q_i\circ q_j=q_j\circ q_i.\label{eq:commute}
\end{equation}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
The statement that $q_i$ is a graph homomorphism means that if $(v,w)$ is an edge in $A$, then so is $(q_i(v),q_i(w))$.  This follows from items 2 and 3 in the definition of an Adinkra above, using $j=c(v,w)$.

The fact that $q_i(q_i(v))=v$ for all $v\in V$ follows from item 2 in the definition, which means that $q_i$ is an involution and in particular is an isomorphism.

The equation (\ref{eq:commute}) follows from item 3 of the definition.
\end{proof}

By combining the $q_1,\ldots, q_n$, we can define an action of $\ZZ_2^n$ on the graph $(V,E)$ underlying the Adinkra in the following way:
\begin{definition}
The action of $\ZZ_2^n$ on the graph $(V,E)$ underlying the Adinkra is given on vertices by
\[(x_1,\ldots,x_N)v=q_1^{x_1}\circ\cdots\circ q_n^{x_n}(v)\]
and the fact that it acts on edges can be seen by the fact that each $q_i$ is a graph homomorphism.
\end{definition}

Suppose $v$ and $w$ are vertices of our Adinkra.  A path from $v$ to $w$ is a sequence of edges $((v,v_1),(v_1,v_2),\ldots,(v_{k-1},w))$ of the underlying graph.  The {\em color sequence} of the path is the sequence $(c(v,v_1),c(v_1,v_2),\ldots,c(v_{k-1},w))$.  So if there is a path from $v$ to $w$ with color sequence $(i_1, \ldots, i_k)$, we have $w=q_{i_k}\circ q_{i_{k-1}}\circ \cdots\circ q_{i_1}(v)$.


Now, define a map $s$ that takes a color sequence and returns an element of $\ZZ_2^n=\{0,1\}^n$ where the $i$-th coordinate is the number of times (modulo $2$) that color $i$ appears in the sequence. For example, $s(3,1,2,1) = 0110$.  Note that $s(d)$ does not depend on the ordering of the color sequence $d$.  This relates to paths in Adinkras because of the following:

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:colorseqpath}
Let $A$ be an Adinkra.  Let $v$ be a vertex of $A$ and let $p$ be a path that begins at $v$.  Let $d$ be the color sequence obtained from $p$.  Then the path $p$ ends at the vertex $s(d)v$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
If the color sequence is $d=(i_1,\ldots,i_k)$, then the path $p$ ends at
$q_{i_k}\circ \cdots \circ q_{i_1}(v)$.  By the commutativity of the $q_i$, we can order them in non-decreasing order of $i_j$.  If any of the $q_i$ appear more than once, we use the fact that $q_i^2$ is the identity to reduce the number of $q_i$ modulo $2$.  The result is $s(d)v$.
\end{proof}


\begin{cor}
\label{prop:pathands}
Let $A$ be an Adinkra.  Let $v$ be a vertex of $A$ and let $p$ and $p'$ be paths that begin at $v$.  Let $d$ and $d'$ be the color sequences obtained from $p$ and $p'$, respectively.  If $s(d)=s(d')$, then $p$ and $p'$ both end at the same point.
\end{cor}



\begin{definition}
Pick a vertex $v\in A$.  Define $C(A,v)$ to be the stabilizer of $v$ under this action of $\ZZ_2^n$.  Since it is a subgroup of $\ZZ_2^n$, $C(A,v)$ is a binary block code of length $n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:transitive}
The Adinkra $A$ is connected if and only if the $\ZZ_2^n$ action is transitive on the vertex set of $A$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let $v$, $w$ be vertices of $A$.  If $A$ is connected, then there is a path in $A$ connecting $v$ to $w$.  The edges in this path have colors $c_1,\ldots,c_k$.  Then $q_{c_1}\cdots q_{c_k}(v)=w$.  By the commutativity of $\ZZ_2^n$, we can rearrange $q_{c_1}\cdots q_{c_k}$ to be in increasing order of $c_i$.  This is then of the form $q_1^{x_1}\circ \cdots \circ q_N^{x_n}$ for some $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in \{0,1\}^n$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
If $A$ is connected, then the code $C(A,v)$ does not depend on $v$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let $w\in V$.  By Proposition~\ref{prop:transitive}, there exists a $\gamma\in \ZZ_2^n$ so that $\gamma v=w$.

Let $\alpha\in \ZZ_2^n$.  The result follows from the sequence of equivalences:
\[\alpha w=w\Leftrightarrow \alpha\gamma v=\gamma v \Leftrightarrow \gamma \alpha v=\gamma v \Leftrightarrow \alpha v=v\]
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
Given a connected Adinkra $A$, the code for $A$, called $C(A)$, is defined to be $C(A,v)$, where $v$ is a vertex of $A$.
\end{definition}




\begin{prop}
\label{prop:paths}
Let $A$ be an Adinkra.  Let $v$ be a vertex of $A$ and let $p$ and $p'$ be paths that begin at $v$.  Let $d$ and $d'$ be the color sequences obtained from $p$ and $p'$, respectively.  The paths $p$ and $p'$ end at the same vertex if and only if 
\[s(d)-s(d')\in C(A).\]
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Suppose $p$ and $p'$ end at the same vertex.  Then
\[s(d)v=s(d')v.\]
Then
\[v=s(d)^{-1}(s(d')v)=s(d)(s(d')v)=(s(d)+s(d'))v=(s(d)-s(d'))v.\]
Note that in this sequence of equations, $\ZZ_2^n$ is written additively but the group action is written multiplicatively.  Also note that $s(d)$ is an involution and in $\ZZ_2^n$, addition and subtraction are the same.  Thus, $s(d)-s(d')\in C(A)$.

Now suppose $s(d)-s(d')\in C(A)$.  Then by reversing the above argument,
\[s(d)v=s(d')v\]
and thus, $p$ and $p'$ end at the same vertex.
\end{proof}



The following Adinkra was defined in [reference].
\begin{definition}
For any non-negative integer $n$, we have an Adinkra $I^n=(V,E,c,\mu,h)$ with
\begin{itemize}
\item $V=\ZZ_2^n=\{0,1\}^n$,
\item $E=\{(v,w)\,|\,\mbox{$v$ and $w$ differ in precisely one coordinate}\}$,
\item $c(v,w)$ is the coordinate where $v$ and $w$ differ,
\item $\mu(v,w)$ is the number of $1$s in $v$ before the coordinate $c(v,w)$, modulo $2$,
\item $h(v)=\wt(v)$ is the number of $1$s in $v$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Given $C$ a linear block code of length $n$, we can define a graph with edge colors $I^n/C$ as the orbit space of the action of $C\subset \ZZ_2^n$ on $I^n$ as a graph.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A graph homomorphism from a graph $(V_1,E_1)$ to a graph $(V_2,E_2)$ is a map $\phi:V_1\to V_2$ so that if $(v,w)\in E_1$ is an edge, then $(\phi(v),\phi(w))\in E_2$ is an edge.  If there is a coloring $c_1:E_1\to\{1,\ldots,n\}$ and a coloring $c_2:E_2\to\{1,\ldots,n\}$, we say that $\phi$ preserves colors if $c_1(v,w)=c_2(\phi(v),\phi(w))$.
\end{definition}

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:cubemodulocode}
If $A$ is a connected Adinkra, then there is a graph isomorphism from $I^n/C(A)$ to $A$ that preserves colors.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Choose a vertex $\overline{0}$ in $A$.  Let
\[\phi:I^n\to A\]
\[\phi(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\overline{0}\]
where we are using the action of $\ZZ_2^n$ on $A$ as described above.

To see that this is a graph homomorphism, let $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in\ZZ_2^n$ and let $(y_1,\ldots,y_n)$ be another vertex connected to $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ with an edge of color $i$.  Then $y_j=x_j$ for all $j\not=i$ and $y_i=1-x_i$.  Then $(y_1,\ldots,y_n)\overline{0}=q_1^{y_1}\cdots q_n^{y_n}\overline{0} =  q_1^{x_1}\cdots q_i^{1-x_i} q_n^{x_n}\overline{0}=q_i(q_1^{x_1}\cdots q_n^{x_n}\overline{0})=q_i(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$.  So $\phi(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ and $\phi(y_1,\ldots,y_n)$ are connected by an edge of color $i$.  Note that this shows that the graph homomorphism preserves colors.

We now prove that $\phi$ is surjective.  Since $A$ is connected, $\ZZ_2^n$ acts transitively on the vertex set of $A$, and so for any vertex $v$ of $A$, there exists an element $\alpha \in\ZZ_2^n$ so that $\alpha \overline{0}=v$.  Then $v=\phi(\alpha)$.

To prove the isomorphism from $I^n/C(A)$ to $A$, we consider the necessary and sufficient conditions for $\phi(x)=\phi(y)$ for $x$, $y\in \ZZ_2^n$.  The condition $\phi(x)=\phi(y)$ is equivalent to $\phi(x-y)\overline{0}=\overline{0}$.  This is equivalent to saying $x-y\in C(A)$.  Thus, the map $\phi$ descends to $I^n/C(A)$ and gives an isomorphism.
\end{proof}

In Reference ..., it was proved that if $A$ is a connected Adinkra, then $C(A)$ is a doubly even code.  Furthermore, if $C$ is any doubly even binary block code of length $n$, then there is an Adinkra with $C(A)=C$.



\begin{lem}
\label{lem:uniqueiso}
Given connected $1$-d Adinkras $A$ and $B$ and vertices $a$ of $A$ and $b$ of $B$, there is at most one graph isomorphism from $A$ to $B$ that preserves colors and sends $a$ to $b$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $\phi:A\to B$ is a graph isomorphism that preserves colors and sends $a$ to $b$.

Let $v$ be a vertex of $A$. Since $A$ is connected, there is a path from $a$ to $v$.  This produces a color sequence $d$.  Since $\phi$ is a graph isomorphism that preserves colors, $\phi$ sends this path to a path in $B$ starting from $b$ with the same color sequence.  Since there is only one path in $B$ with this property, this determines the endpoint of the path, which is $\phi(v)$.
\end{proof}




\subsection{$2$-d Adinkras}
The notion of $2$-d Adinkras is described in Ref...[fill in references to various things].  We use a definition here that is equivalent to the one found in [some reference]: the proof is found in Appendix...[maybe?]

A $2$-d Adinkra is similar to a $1$-d Adinkra except that some colors are called ``left-moving'' and the other colors called ``right-moving''.  Edges are called ``left-moving'' if they are colored by left-moving edges, and right-moving otherwise.  Furthermore, there are two gradings, one that is affected by the left-moving edges and the other for the right-moving edges.

More formally,
\begin{definition}
Let $p$ and $q$ be non-negative integers.   A 2-d Adinkra with $(p,q)$ colors is a 1-d Adinkra $(V,E,c,\mu,h)$ with $p+q$ colors, and two grading functions $h_L:V\to \ZZ$ and $h_R:V\to \ZZ$ so that
\begin{itemize}
\item $h(v)=h_L(v)+h_R(v)$
\item if $(v,w)\in E$ and $c(v,w)\le p$, then $|h_L(v)-h_L(w)|=1$ and $h_R(v)=h_R(w)$.  If $(v,w)\in E$ and $c(v,w)>p$, then $|h_R(v)-h_R(w)|=1$ and $h_L(v)=h_R(w)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}


\subsection{Product of Adinkras}
One way to get $2$-d Adinkras is to take a product of two $1$-d Adinkras, where the first Adinkra uses only left-moving colors and the second Adinkra uses only right-moving colors.

\begin{definition}
Let $p$ and $q$ be non-negative integers.  Let $A_1=(V_1, E_1, c_1, \mu_1,h_1)$ be a $1$-d Adinkra with $p$ colors and let $A_2=(V_2, E_2, c_2, \mu_2,h_2)$ be a $1$-d Adinkra $q$ colors.  We can define the product of these Adinkras as the following 2-Adinkra with $(p,q)$ colors:
\[A_1\times A_2=(V,E,c,\mu,h_L,h_R)\]
where
\begin{eqnarray*}
V&=&V_1\times V_2\\
E&=&E_1\cup E_2\mbox{ where}\\
E_1&=&\{((v_1,w),(v_2,w))\,|\,(v_1, v_2)\in E_1,\mbox{ and } w\in V_2\}\\
E_2&=&\{((v,w_1),(v,w_2))\,|\,v\in V, \mbox{ and }(w_1,w_2)\in E_2\}\\
c((v_1,w),(v_2,w))&=&c_1(v_1,v_2)\mbox{ for all $((v_1,w),(v_2,w))\in E_1$}\\
c((v,w_1),(v,w_2))&=&p+c_2(w_1,w_2)\mbox{ for all $(v,w_1),(v,w_2)\in E_2$}\\
h_L(v,w)&=&h_1(v)\\
h_R(v,w)&=&h_2(w)\\
\mu((v_1,w),(v_2,w))&=&\mu_1(v_1,v_2)\\
\mu((v,w_1),(v,w_2))&=&(-1)^{h_1(v)}\mu_2(w_1,w_2)
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let $p$ and $q$ be non-negative integers and let $n=p+q$.

Given a binary block code $C$ of length $p$, we can define a binary block code $\hat{C}$ of length $n$ by appending to the end of every code word in $C$ a string of $0$s of length $q$.

Likewise, given a binary block code $C$ of length $q$, we can define a binary block code $\check{C}$ of length $n$ by prepending to the beginning of every code word in $C$ a string of $0$s of length $p$.
\end{definition}

\begin{prop}
Let $A_1$ and $A_2$ be as above.  Then
\[C(A_1\times A_2)=\hat{C}(A_1)\oplus \check{C}(A_2).\]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let $(v_1,v_2)\in A_1\times A_2$.  Let $g\in \ZZ_2^N$.  We can write $g=g_1+g_2$ where $g_1$ is zero in the last $q$ bits and $g_2$ is zero in the first $p$ bits.  Now
\[g(v_1,v_2)=(g_1+g_2)(v_1,v_2)=(g_1v_1,g_2v_2).\]
This means that $g(v_1,v_2)=(v_1,v_2)$ if and only if $g_1v_1=v_1$ and $g_2 v_2=v_2$.

So $g\in C(A_1\times A_2)$ if and only if $g_1\in \hat{C}(A_1)$ and $g_2\in \check{C}(A_2)$.
\end{proof}



\section{Structural Theorems}

In this section, we show that the coherence conditions of $2$-d adinkras force a lot of structure onto them. In particular, we can think of the vertices of $2$-d adinkras as arranged in a rectangle, with the stucture of the entire adinkra basically determined by a horizontal and a vertical ``slice'' of the picture.

\subsection{A $2$-d Adinkra Fits in a Rectangle}

Let the \emph{support} of a $2$-d adinkra (and/or its bigrading function $(h_L,h_R)$) be defined as the range of $(h_L,h_R)$, its bigrading function. Now, we show that the support of a connected $2$-d adinkra must form a rectangle in $\ZZ^2$.



% In this and the following sections, it helps to have some standard assumptions:

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Recall that any $1$-d adinkra has vertices labeled by equivalence classes of $\ZZ_2^n$ by some $(n,k)$ doubly-even code $C$. We will refer to vertices by these equivalence classes (or their representatives). We use the notation $(v_1, \ldots, v_n)$ and $(v_1 v_2 \cdots v_n)$ interchangeably.
%% No longer needed: \item Without loss of generality, let our color set $C_L \cup C_R = \{1,2,\ldots, n\}$, with $C_L = \{1, 2, \ldots, p\}$ and $C_R = \{p+1, p+2, \ldots, p+q=n\}$. We now identify these $n$ elements with the $n$ indices of the vertices thinking of them as the indices of $\ZZ_2^n$. For all $i \in C_L \cup C_R$, define the map $q_i$ that takes a vertex $v$ and returns the unique vertex joined to $v$ by an edge of color $i$. So if $v = (v_1, \ldots, v_n)$, $q_i(v) = (v_1, cdots, v_{i-1}, 1-v_i, v_{i+1}, \cdots, v_n)$. Note that $q_i^2(v) = v$.
% But: do we need the N-cube?
%\item We will always define $\overline{0}$ to be the vertex corresponding to the equivalence class of $(00\cdots0)$. We will also assume that $g(\overline{0}) = (0,0)$. 
%\end{itemize}


Let $d$ be a color sequence.  Let $l(d)$ be a rearrangement of $d$ that moves all the left-moving colors to the beginning, and let $r(d)$ be a rearrangement of $d$ that moves all the right-moving colors to the beginning. Thus, suppose $p = q = 2$, we have $l((3,1,2,1)) = (2,1,1,3)$ and $r((3,1,2,1)) = (3,2,1,1)$. We always have $s(l(d)) = s(r(d))$ in general, since $l(d)$ and $r(d)$ are just permutations of each other.

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:rectangle-completion}
Let $A$ be a connected Adinkra.  Suppose $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ are in the support of $A$.  Then $(x_1,y_2)$ and $(x_2,y_1)$ are also in the support of $A$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
The statement that $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is in the support of $A$ means that there exist vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$ of $A$ with $(h_L(v_1),h_R(v_1))=(x_1,y_1)$ and $(h_L(v_2),h_R(v_2))=(x_2,y_2)$, respectively.  Since $A$ is connected, there exists a path from $v_1$ to $v_2$.

Let $d$ be the color sequence of this path.  Now $l(d)$ is a color sequence that can be written as a concatenation $ab$ where $a$ is a color sequence only involving left-moving colors, and $b$ is a color sequence only involving right-moving colors.  Consider the vertex $u=s(a)v_1$.  The color sequence $a$ describes a path from $v_1$ to $u$ involving only left-moving colors, and so $h_R(u)=h_R(v_1)=y_1$.  The color sequence $b$ describes a path from $u$ to $v_2$ involving only right-moving colors, and so $h_L(u)=h_L(v_2)=x_2$.  To summarize, $(h_L(u),h_R(u))=(x_2,y_1)$.

Repeating this procedure with $r(d)$ likewise provides a vertex $w$ with $(h_L(w),h_R(w))=(x_1,y_2)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
\label{cor:rectangle}
The support of a connected $2$-d adinkra is a rectangle.  That is, there exist integers $x_0$, $x_1$, $y_0$, and $y_1$ so that the support is
\[\{(x,y)\in\ZZ^2\,|\,x_0\le x\le x_1\mbox{ and }y_0\le y\le y_1\}\]
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
Let $x_0$ and $y_0$ be the minima of the $x$ and $y$ coordinates, respectively, of the support of the Adinkra.  By Proposition~\ref{prop:rectangle-completion}, $(x_0,y_0)$ is in the support as well.

Likewise, if $x_1$ and $y_1$ are the maxima of the $x$ and $y$ coordinates, respectively, of the support of the Adinkra, then $(x_1,y_1)$ is in the support.  By Proposition~\ref{prop:rectangle-completion}, $(x_1,y_0)$ and $(x_0,y_1)$ are also in the support.

Since the Adinkra is connected, there must be paths from vertices with bigrading $(x_0,y_0)$ to vertices with bigrading $(x_1,y_1)$.  Since $h_L$ and $h_R$ can change by at most 1 along these paths, we see that for all $x_0\le x\le x_1$, there must exist $y_x$ so that $(x,y_x)$ is in the support.  Likewise for all $y_0\le y\le y_1$, there must exist $x_y$ so that $(x_y,y)$ is in the support.  By application of Proposition~\ref{prop:rectangle-completion} again, we get that $(x,y)$ is in the support for all $x_0\le x\le x_1$ and $y_0\le y\le y_1$.
\end{proof}

While it is neat that the vertices of a $2$-d adinkra $A$ line up nicely in a rectangle, we now show that there is even more regularity in its structure. Let $A_L$ (resp. $A_R)$ be the subgraphs of $A$ induced by left-moving (resp. right-moving) edges of $A$. %

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:qiso}
Let $A$ be a $2$-d Adinkra.  If $X$ is a connected component of $A_L$ and $i$ is a right-moving color, then there is a graph isomorphism between $X$ and $q_i(X)$ that preserves colors and $h_L$.  The analogous statement for $A_R$ also holds.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Propostion~\ref{prop:qmap} states that $q_i$ is a graph isomorphism from the underlying graph of $A$ to itself that preserves colors.  If we restrict  $q_i$ to a connected component $X$ of $A_L$, the restricted map is an isomorphism from $X$ to $q_i(X)$ that preserves colors.

Since $i$ is a right-moving color, then for all vertices $v\in X$, $h_L(v)=h_L(q_i(v))$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:qiconnected}
Let $A$ be a $2$-d Adinkra.  If $X$ is a connected component of $A_L$ and $i$ is a right-moving color, then $q_i(X)$ is the vertex set of a connected component of $A_L$. The analogous statement for $A_R$ also holds.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Because the property of connectedness is preserved under graph isomorphism, we know that $q_i(X)$ is connected.  If we let $X'$ be the connected component of $A_L$ that contains $q_i(X)$, then the same argument proves that $q_i(X')$ is connected as well.  Since $X$ was assumed to be a connected component of $A_L$, we have that $q_i(X')\subseteq X$.  But since $q_i^2$ is the identity, $X=q_i^2(X)\subseteq q_i(X')\subseteq X$.  This means $q_i(X')=X$.  By the fact that $q_i^2$ is the identity, we also have $q_i(X)=X'$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:kevin}
Let $A$ be a connected $2$-d Adinkra.  All connected components of $A_L$ (and respectively $A_R$) are isomorphic as graded posets.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be two connected components of $A_L$. Pick vertices $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$. Since $A$ is connected, there is a path from $x$ to $y$ in $A$. Reorder the path so that the right-moving edges occur before the left-moving edges. Since the left-moving edges stay in $Y$, the right-moving edges alone take $x$ to a vertex $y' \in Y$.  The sequence of right-moving edges provides a color sequence $i_1,\ldots,i_k$, and thus, a sequence of compositions $q_{i_k}\circ\cdots\circ q_{i_1}$.  Now $q_{i_k}\circ\cdots\circ q_{i_1}(x)=y'$.  By repeated application of Lemma~\ref{lem:qiconnected}, we have that $q_{i_k}\circ\cdots\circ q_{i_1}(X)$ is a connected component of $A_L$ that contains $y'$, which is $Y$.  By repeated application of Lemma~\ref{lem:qiso}, we have an isomorphism of graphs that preserves colors and the grading $h_L$.
\end{proof}

%Let the \emph{left boundary} $B_L(A)$ and \emph{right boundary} $B_R(A)$ of the rectangle be the subgraphs of $A$ induced by vertices of $A$ that occur at the sets $\{(i,0) | 0 \leq i < l \}$ and $\{(0, j) | 0 \leq j < k \}$ respectively. It helps to picture the normal Cartesian plane rotated $45$ degrees counterclockwise, because then adjectives refer to the direction of ``movement'': this way, the left boundary corresponds to the lower-left vertices in the support rectangle and the right boundary corresponds to the lower-right vertices.

With all this redundancy, what is the minimal amount of information required for us to understand a $2$-d adinkra? Proposition~\ref{prop:kevin} suggests we just need a single connected component for each direction to give us all the data; this turns out to basically be true, as we see in the next section.

\begin{comment}
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:square}
In a $2$-d adinkra, suppose we have a path $(x, y \pm_1 1) \rightarrow (x, y) \rightarrow (x \pm_2 1, y)$, where each $\pm_i$ corresponds to a choice of sign, the first and the last vertices are connected to $(x \pm_2 1, y \pm_1 1)$ via the corresponding colors in a square.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Because we have an ($1$-d) adinkra, the two edges in this path correspond to two different colors (WLOG $1$ and $2$ in order) respectively, and if we use the colors $2$ and $1$ in order we must also reach $(x \pm_2 1, y)$ from $(x, y \pm_1 1)$. Because left-moving colors only correspond to $y$-axis moves in the $\ZZ^2$ bigrading, and right-moving colors only correspond to $x$-axis moves, the first move must have displacement $(\pm_2 1, 0)$ and the second move must have displacement $(0, \pm_1)$. This is exactly equivalent to the statement.
\end{proof}

We will worry less about exact rankings right now with the following construction:

\section{Quotienting}
To understand quotients, we first define the homomorphism from one $2$-d Adinkra to another.  This will be similar to the definition of homomorphism of graphs [give some standard reference to this terminology].

\begin{definition}
Let 
$A_1=(V_1,E_1,c_1,\mu_1,h_{L1},h_{R1})$
and
$A_2=(V_2,E_2,c_2,\mu_2,h_{L2},h_{R2})$
be 2-Adinkras with $(p,q)$ colors.  A homomorphism from $A_1$ to $A_2$ is a map
\[\phi:V_1\to V_2\]
satisfying the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $(v,w)\in E_1$, then $\phi(v,w)\in E_2$ and $c_1(v,w)=c_2(\phi(v,w))$.
\item If $v\in V_1$ then $h_{1L}(v)=h_{2L}(\phi(v))$.
\item If $v\in V_1$ then $h_{1R}(v)=h_{2R}(\phi(v))$.
\end{itemize}
Note that there is no condition on the dashings $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$.
\end{definition}


The main result of this section is the following theorem:
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:quotient}
Let $A$ be a connected $2$-d Adinkra.  Fix a vertex $\overline{0}$ in $A$ and let $A_L^0$ (resp. $A_R^0$) be the connected component of $A_L$ (resp. $A_R$) containing $\overline{0}$.

There is a binary block code $K$ of length $n$ so that $K\cap \hat{C}(A_L^0)=0$ and $K\cap \check{C}(A_R^0)=0$, and there is an isomorphism
\[A\cong (A_L^0\times A_R^0)/K\]
of the underlying graphs that preserves colors and the bigrading.
\end{thm}

Before we begin it will help to understand the relationship of the codes.
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:cplus}
\[\hat{C}(A_L^0)\oplus \check{C}(A_R^0) \subseteq C(A).\]
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Let $g\in\hat{C}(A_L^0)$ and $h\in \check{C}(A_R^0)$.  Then $g\overline{0}=\overline{0}$ because applying $g$ to $\overline{0}$ results in a path that lies completely inside $A_L^0$, and so the fact that $g\overline{0}=\overline{0}$ in $A_L^0$ (since $g\in \hat{C}(A_L^0)$) results in $g\overline{0}=\overline{0}$ in $A$.  Likewise $h\overline{0}=\overline{0}$.  So $(g+h)\overline{0}=g(h(\overline{0}))=\overline{0}$ and $g+h\in C(A)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:quotient}]
From Lemma~\ref{lem:cplus} and basic linear algebra, there exists a vector subspace $K$ of $\ZZ_2^N$ that is a vector space complement of
$\hat{C}(A_L^0)\oplus \check{C}(A_R^0)$ in $C(A)$.  That is,
\[C(A)=\hat{C}(A_L^0)\oplus \check{C}(A_R^0)\oplus K.\]
Then by Theorem~\ref{thm:cubemodulocode}, there is an isomorphism
\[i_1:A\cong I^n/C(A)\]
that preserves colors.  The proof of this began with choosing a special vertex in $A$, and we specify here that we should use our chosen vertex $\overline{0}\in $A$.  This isomorphism then sends $\overline{0}$ to the coset containing $(0,\ldots,0)$ in $I^n/C(A)$.

We now note that
\begin{eqnarray*}
I^n/C(A)
&=&I^n/(\hat{C}(A_L^0)\oplus \check{C}(A_R^0)\oplus K)\\
&=&(I^n/(\hat{C}(A_L^0)\oplus \check{C}(A_R^0)))/ K\\
&=&(I^n/C(A_L^0 \times A_R^0))/ K
\end{eqnarray*}
and again apply Theorem~\ref{cubemodulocode} to establish an isomorphism
\[i_2:(I^n/C(A_L^0 \times A_R^0))/ K\cong (A_L^0\times A_R^0)/K\]
that preserves colors and sends the coset of $(0,\ldots,0)$ to $(\overline{0},\overline{0})$.

We compose these isomorphisms to define
\[i_3:A\to (A_L^0\times A_R^0)/K\]
an isomorphism of graphs that preserves colors.



We now restrict $i_3$ to $A_L^0$.  This gives an isomorphism from $A_L^0$ to $A_L^0\times\{\overline{0}}$.  It preserves colors and sends $\overline{0}$ to $(\overline{0},\overline{0})$.  It is in fact the map that sends a vertex $v$ in $A_L^0$ to $(v,\overline{0})$.  This can be seen by the fact that the map sending $v$ to $(v,\overline{0})$ is also an isomorphism that preserves colors and sends $\overline{0}$ to $(\overline{0},\overline{0})$, and by Lemma~\ref{lem:uniqueiso}, such a map is unique.  Therefore, $i_3(v)=(v,\overline{0})$ for all vertices $v$ in $A_L^0$.  Likewise, if $v\in A_R^0$, then $i_3(v)=(\overline{0},v)$.

Now let $v$ be any vertex of $A$.  The map $i_3$ sends $v$ to a pair $(u,w)$ where $u\in A_L^0$ and $w\in A_R^0$.  There is a path from $\overline{0}$ to $v$.  This gives a color sequence $d$.  

  Let $p$ be a path from $\overline{0}$ to $v$.


obsolete proof:

If $v$ is any vertex in $A_L^0$, there is a path from $\overline{0}$ to $v$ that stays completely inside $A_L^0$.  This produces a color sequence with only left-moving colors, and since $i_3$ preserves colors, $i_3$ must send this path to a path within $A_L^0\times A_R^0$ with the same color sequence.  Since these are all left-moving colors, the image of this path under $i_3$ must be completely inside $A_L^0\times \{\overline{0}\}$, and since the path is determined by the color sequence, and since $A_L^0\times\{\overline{0}\}$ is by definition isomorphic to $A_L^0$ as a graph with colors and grading, we conclude that $i_3$ is the identity on this path.  In particular, $i_3(v)=(v,\overline{0})$.


Now to continue with the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:quotient},


For the next step we verify that this isomorphism preserves the bigrading $(h_L,h_R)$.  For this we follow the above series of isomorphisms step by step with the bigrading.

We use the isomorphism $i_1$ to push the bigrading on $A$ onto $I^n/C(A)$.  This bigrading then lifts to a bigrading of $I^n$ with the property that if $\alpha\in C(A)$ and $v\in I^n$, then $h_L(\alpha v)=h_L(v)$ and $h_R(\alpha v)=h_R(v)$.

The sequence of equalities that gives
\[I^n/C(A)=(I^n/C(A_L^0\times A_R^0))/K\]
defines the bigrading $(h_L,h_R)$ on $(I^n/C(A_L^0\times A_R^0))/K$.



Since the series of isomorphisms sends $\overline{0}$ to $(\overline{0},\overline{0})$, and preserves colors, 





Let $(v,w)$ be a vertex of $A_L^0\times A_R^0$, and let $\alpha\in K$.  Then $\alpha\in C(A)$.  We write $\alpha=\alpha_L+\alpha_R$ where $\alpha_L$ has $0$s for the last $q$ coordinates and $\alpha_R$ has $0$s for the first $p$ coordinates.  Then $\alpha_L(v)\in A_L^0$, and $\alpha_R(\alpha_L(v))=v$.  Since $\alpha_R$ preserves $h_L$, we have $h_L(\alpha_L(v))=h_L(v)$.

Then we have
\[h_L(\alpha(v,w))=h_L((\alpha_L(v),\alpha_R(w))=h_L(\alpha_L(v))=h_L(v)\]
Likewise, $h_R(\alpha(v,w))=h_R(v)$.

So the bigrading $(h_L,h_R)$ descends to the quotient.

By definition,
\[h_L(\overline{0},\overline{0})=h_L(\overline{0})=h_L(\phi(\overline{0},\overline{0})).\]

Now let $(v,w)\in A_L^0\times A_R^0$ and consider $h_L(v,w)$ and $h_L(\phi(v,w))$.     ...  I guess we don't have $\phi$ defined explicitly here.  [to be completed later]

The proof is similar for $h_R$.
\end{proof}


[Now discuss dashing]

\section{ESDE Codes}

Define a \emph{even-split doubly-even (ESDE) code} to be a doubly-even code isomorphic to a direct sum $C_L \oplus C_R$ of even codes. Recall that $1$-d chromotopologies are in bijection with quotients of the hamming cube $I^n$ by a doubly-even code $L$, so any adinkra $A$ has a well-defined associated code $L(A)$ that is uniquely determined by just the graph structure of the adinkra. Our goal is to show that ESDE codes are exactly the codes that appear for $2$-d adinkras. To do this, we introduce a special family of $2$-d adinkras.

For an $1$-d adinkra $A$ with grading function $g$, let $\val(A)$, the \emph{valise} of $A$, be defined as a $1$-d adinkra $A'$ identical to $A$ except for its grading function $g'$, defined as $g'(v) = 0$ if $g(v) \in 2\ZZ$ and $1$ otherwise. It is easy to see that $\val(A)$ is also an adinkra. Similarly, for any $2$-d adinkra $A$ with bigrading function $g$, there is a unique $2$-d adinkra $A'$ with the same chromotopology as $A$ such that $(A')_L^0 = \val(A_L^0)$ and $(A')_R^0 = \val(A_R^0)$, defined with a bigrading function $g'(v) = (x', y')$, where $x', y' \in \{0,1\}$ depending on $x$ and $y \pmod(2)$ respectively given $g(v) = (x,y)$. We similarly denote $A'$ by $\val(A)$ and call such an adinkra a \emph{valise} ($2$-d) adinkra. Equivalently, a valise adinkra is one where the supporting rectangle is a $2 \times 2$ square, and any $2$-d adinkra could be put into a valise form.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:esde}
For a code $L \subset \ZZ_2^n$, there exists a $2$-d adinkra $A$ with $L(A) = L$ if and only if $L$ is a ESDE code.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $L(A) = L$ for some $2$-d adinkra $A$. We know that $L$ is doubly-even. Consider any codeword $l \in L$. Starting at $\overline{0} \in A$, moving by a path corresponding to $l$ must end up back at $\overline{0}$. In particular, it must use an even number of left-moving (resp. right-moving) edges since each of which changes the $x$-coordinate (resp. $y$-coordinate) by $1$ in absolute value. Thus, $L$ must be ESDE.

Now, take an ESDE code $L$. $L$ is doubly-even, so there exists a $1$-d adinkra $A$ with code $L(A) = L$. We can assume $A$ is a $1$-d valise by taking $A = \val(A)$ if necessary, which does not change the code. Now, any vertex $v \in A$ corresponds to an equivalence class $c+L \subset \ZZ_2^n.$ consider the function $g'\colon V(A) \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ that sends $v$ to $(x,y)$, where $x$ (resp. $y$) corresponds to the parity of the weight of the left-moving colors of any element in $c+L$. The fact that $L$ is ESDE precisely makes this notion well-defined. Since $g'$ gives $A$ a bigrading, $A$ is realizable as a $2$-d valise adinkra $A$ with code $L$, so we are done. 
\end{proof}


\appendix
\section{Equivalence with other notions of $2$-d Adinkras}


If I read Tristan's stuff right, we can completely translate the combinatorial rules to: a \emph{2-d adinkra} (of dimension $n$) is a finite simple connected graph $A$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is an $1$-d adinkra (with the associated ranking, dashing, etc.).
\item It has $p + q = n$ colors, where the first $p$-colors are called ``left-moving'' and the second $q$-colors are called ``right-moving.''
\item A coherence condition: for any cycle, we imagine the following sum: going up (here ``up'' comes from the grading we have from the engineering dimension in our ranking for the $1$-d adinkra) a left-handed edge adds $-1$, and going up a right-handed edge adds $1$; going down the edges give contributions with opposite signs. The sum of this around any cycle must be $0$. (in particular, this rules out things like ambidextrous bow-ties)
\end{itemize} 

Assuming I interpreted these rules correctly, now I can do combinatorics without needing any physics.

%%

The first structural fact we can impose is a bi-grading that is compatible with the grading we already have from the $1$-d adinkra structure, in the sense that the $1$-d grading is simply one of the coordinates of our bi-grading.

\begin{prop}
A $1$-d adinkra can be extended to a $2$-d adinkra if and only if the $1$-d adinkra has a \emph{bigrading} to $\ZZ^2$. This is a map $g: V \rightarrow \ZZ^2$, such that all left-moving edges correspond to displacements of $(0, 1)$ and right-moving edges correspond to displacements of $(1, 0)$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Proof delayed until talking more with Kevin and Tristan about the easiest way to write things up to avoid reinventing wheels.
\end{proof}

\section{Misc. (unorganized)}

\begin{cor}
\label{cor:factorization-connected-components}
Consider the vertex $\overline{0} \in A$. Let the connected component of $A_L$ (resp. $A_R$) that $\overline{0}$ belongs to be labeled $A_L^0$ (resp. $A_R^0$). The adinkra $A$ is uniquely determined\footnote{This is fairly nuanced; we need to know not just the shape of $A_L^0$ and $A_R^0$, but also their vertices} by $A_L^0$ and $A_R^0$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
Consider the color sequence $d$ of any path from $\overline{0}$ to a vertex $v$. We can permute the sequence so that the left-moving colors all occur before the right-moving colors. Thus, we first make some moves in $A_L^0$, then by Proposition~\ref{prop:kevin} we make the remaining moves in a copy of $A_R^0$. 
\end{proof}


\begin{cor}
\label{cor:valise factorization}
A valise $2$-d adinkra $A$ of type $(n,k)$ is uniquely determined by $B_L(A)$, $B_R(A)$, and an identification of $V(B_L(A), 0)$ and $V(B_R(A), 0)$. Furthermore, $|B_L(A)| = |B_R(A)| = 2^{n-k-1}$.
\end{cor}


\begin{prob}
What are all the $2$-d adinkras $A$ with the same valise adinkra $\val(A)$? Not all lifts are possible. For example, the adinkra in Figure~\ref{fig:tight valise} cannot be lifted to any non-valise form!
\end{prob}


\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{Adinkras}

Here are some other problems:
\begin{prob}
Given two valise $1$-d adinkras $B_L(A)$ and $B_R(A)$ of equal size, what identifications of $V(B_L(A), 0)$ and $V(B_R(A), 0)$ are possible?
\end{prob}
\begin{proof}
Data: if we have $\{0,1\} \cup \{2,3\}$ on one side, the other side must be $\{0,2\} \cup \{1, 3\}$.
\end{proof}

\com{There are two kinds of quotienting that we can think of: one quotient is directly quotienting the mega hypercube adinkra by a ESDE code; one quotient is given the valise adinkra with associated $B_L(A)$, $B_R(A)$ each with $2^{d+1}$ vertices, the necessary $d$-dimensional quotienting that occurs when we naively tensor the two parts (which gives $2^{2d}$ vertices in each corner, for $2^{2d+2}$ total vertices, when in the end we just want $2^{d+2}$ vertices.}
